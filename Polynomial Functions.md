A **polynomial** [[Functions|function]] a function that is defined by a [[Polynomials|polynomial]] expression. So a polynomial function of degree $n$ assumes the form:
$$\begin{align*}
P(x)&= a_{n}x^{n}+ a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \dotsc+ a_{1}x+a_{0} \; \; \; a_{n}\ne 0
\end{align*}$$
- Each term $a$ is called a **coefficient.**
- The $a_{n}$ term, the coefficient with the highest power, it's called the **leading coefficient**.
- the $a_{0}$ term is the **constant term**.
- the $a_{n}x^{n}$ term, the highest power term, is called the **leading term**.2
