The **Intermediate Value Theorem for [[Polynomials]]** Says that if $P$ is a [[Polynomial Functions|polynomial function]] and $P(a)$ and $P(b)$ have opposites signs, then there exists some value $c$ for which $P(c) = 0$, it makes total sense right, if a **continous** function goes from $-3$ to $5$ in the $y$-axis then at some point $c$ it is $0$.
