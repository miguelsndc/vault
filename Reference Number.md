Let $t$ be a [[Real Numbers|real number]]. The **reference number** $\overline{t}$ associated with $t$ is the **shortest distance** between $t$ and the $x$-axis.
It's useful to know in which **quadrant** the point lies in the [[Unit Circle]], if it's on Quadrant $I$ or $IV$ where $x$ is positive, we find $\overline{t}$ by moving it along the circle to the positive $x$-axis.
It it lies on the $II$ or $III$ Quadrant, where $x$ is negative, we move it along the circle to the negative $x$-axis
