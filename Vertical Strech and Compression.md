Vertical stretching and shrinking are a transformation we can apply to make the $y$-values of a function more extreme, making it look like it "stretched" or "shrinked". 
Suppose we have a [[Functions|function]] $y=f(x)$, and a constant $c$. Note:
- if $y=cf(x)$ where $0< c < 1$ we are **shrinking** the [[Graph of a Function|graph]] of $y$, because multiplying a value by some other value smaller than $1$, makes the output smaller, making the values of $y$ more sparse, therefore looking shrinked .
- if $y=cf(x)$ where $c > 1$ we are **stretching** the graph of $y$, because multiplying a value by others who are larger than $1$ considerably increases the values of $y$ for every $x$, making the $y$-values more distant from each other, therefore being closer to the $y$-axis, hence looking stretched.
