The contrapositive is one of the three operations that can be derived from the [[Conditional Statement]], being defined as $\neg q \implies \neg p$. It's the only operation that has the same truth values as $p \implies q$. See:
___ 
The only way for $\neg q \implies \neg p$ to be false is when $\neg q$ is true and $\neg p$ is false, that is, when $p$ is true and $q$ is false. We will show that neither the [[Converse]] nor the [[Inverse]] have the same truth values.
