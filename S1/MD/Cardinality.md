Pretty much the length of a [[S1/MD/Sets|set]], cardinality refers to the number $n$ of **distinct** elements in $S$, where $n \in \mathbb{N}^{+}$. Is denoted as $|S|$.
See:
$$\begin{align*}
A &=  \{x | (x\pmod{2}) = 1\land x<10\}\\
A &= \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}\\
|A|&= 5\\
\end{align*}
$$
Also note that:
$$\begin{align*}
|\emptyset| &= 0
\end{align*}$$
