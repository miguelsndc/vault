The **magnitude, length or norm** $a$ of a [[Vector]] $\vec{v}$ is $||\vec{v}|| = a$. 

For a radius-vector $\vec{b}$ with [[Vector Components|components]] $<2, 3, 5>$ we have a [[Distance Formula|distance]] of $\sqrt{39}$ from the origin, therefore, $\vec{b}$ has a **magnitude** of $\sqrt{39}$ regardless of direction.
