The **magnitude, length or norm** $a$ of a [[Vector]] $\vec{v}$ plotted within a two-dimensional system is:
$$\begin{align*}
\vec{v} &= (x_{1},y_{1})\\
||\vec{v}||^{2} &= x_{1}^{2} + y_{1}^{2}\\
||\vec{v}|| &= \sqrt{x_{1}^{2} + y_{1}^{2}\\}
\end{align*}$$

The $||\vec{v}||$ syntax stands for **norm**, note that the result of this pythagorean theorem is exactly the [[Scalar Product]] of $\vec{v}$ with itself, so we can say that:

> The norm of a vector $\vec{v}$ is the square root of the scalar product of $\vec{v}$ with itself.
