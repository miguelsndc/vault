>In here we consider vectors as *three-dimensional* but things also apply for 2D vectors.

Vectors in some coordinate system is a ordered triplet of numbers that follows some rules of addition and multiplication, and are transformed with the system.

The members of a triplet are called the **coordinates of the vector**, Vectors can be represented using a special [[Notation for vectors]], here we use $\vec{v}$.
#### Geometrical Interpretation

Let $\vec{a} = \{a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}\}$ be arbitrary vector and $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ be two points with coordinates $(x_{1},y_{1},z_{1})$ and $(x_{2},y_{2},z_{2})$, chosen to satisfy: $a_{1}=(x_{2}-x_{1})$, $a_{2}=(y_{2}-y_{1})$ and $a_{3}=(z_{2}-z_{1})$.

Therefore a vector $\vec{a}$ can be interpreted as the **line segment** between points $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$.

The **length** of $\vec{a}$ is the length of the segment joining $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$. Or so to say the [[Distance Formula|distance]] between $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$.
