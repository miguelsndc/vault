>In here we consider vectors as *three-dimensional* but things also apply for 2D vectors.

Vectors in some coordinate system is a ordered triplet of numbers that follows some rules of addition and multiplication, and are transformed with the system.
The members of a triplet are called the **coordinates of the vector**, Vectors can be represented using a special [[Notation for vectors]], here we use $\vec{v}$.
