Real numbers represent is a number system that includes **natural, integers, rational and irrational** numbers.

- Natural $\rightarrow$ all positive whole numbers
- Integer $\rightarrow$ all positive and negative numbers.
- Rational $\rightarrow$ ratios of other numbers (division by zero is ruled-out).
- Irrational $\rightarrow$ Can't be expressed by a ratio of two numbers.

	A repeating decimal like $x = 3.5474747474...$ is a rational number and we can write it as ratio of two integers by multiplying $x$ by appropriate parts of 10 and subtract to eliminate de repeating part such as:
	$$\begin{align*}
x &= 3.5474747474...\\
1000x &= 3547.4747474...\\
10x&= 35.474747474...\\
1000x - 10x=990x &= 3512\\
x &= \frac{3512}{990}
\end{align*}$$
