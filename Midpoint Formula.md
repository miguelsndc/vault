The Midpoint Formula $M(x,y)$ for $A(x_{1},y_{1})$ and $B(x_{2}, y_{2})$ is:
$$\begin{align*}
M(x,y)&= \bigg(\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}}{2}, \frac{y_{1} + y_{2}}{2} \bigg)
\end{align*}$$

### Proof

To find the Midpoint $M(x,y)$ between $A(x_{1},y_{1})$ and $B(x_{2},y_{2})$, we first notice that the triangles $\triangle{APM}$ and $\triangle{MQB}$ are congruents.
