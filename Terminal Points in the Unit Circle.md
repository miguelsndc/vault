Suppose $t$ is a [[Real Numbers|real number]], if $t \ge 0$, we're gonna mark a distance $t$ starting at the point $(1,0)$ in the [[Unit Circle]], and move in counterclockwise direction, we $t\lt0$, we're gonna mark a distance $|t|$ and move in clockwise direction.
Points $P(x,y)$ found like this are called **terminal points**.

The unit circle has a circumference of $2\pi$, therefore:
- If we start at $(1,0)$ and travel all the way and go back to $(1,0)$, we traveled a distance of $2\pi$.
- To move halfway around the circle we traveled a distance of $\frac{1}{2}(2\pi)=\pi$.
- To move a quarter around the circle we traveled a distance of $\frac{1}{4}(2\pi) = \frac{\pi}{2}$ 
And we keep moving around by using these ratios of $\pi$
