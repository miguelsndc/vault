Suppose $t$ is a [[Real Numbers|real number]], if $t \ge 0$, we're gonna mark a distance $t$ starting at the point $(1,0)$ in the [[Unit Circle]], and move in counterclockwise direction, we $t\lt0$, we're gonna mark a distance $|t|$ and move in clockwise direction.
Points $P(x,y)$ found like this are called **terminal points**.

The unit circle has a circumference of $2\pi$, therefore, if we start at $(1,0)$ and travel al
