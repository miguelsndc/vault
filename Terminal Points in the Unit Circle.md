Suppose $t$ is a [[Real Numbers|real number]], if $t \ge 0$, we're gonna mark a distance $t$ starting at the point $(1,0)$ in the [[Unit Circle]], and move in counterclockwise direction, we $t\lt0$, we're gonna mark a distance $|t|$ and move in clockwise direction.
Points $P(x,y)$ found like this are called **terminal points**.

The unit circle has a circumference of $2\pi$, therefore:
- If we start at $(1,0)$ and travel all the way and go back to $(1,0)$, we traveled a distance of $2\pi$.
- To move halfway around the circle we traveled a distance of $\frac{1}{2}(2\pi)=\pi$.
- To move a quarter around the circle we traveled a distance of $\frac{1}{4}(2\pi) = \frac{\pi}{2}$ 
And we keep moving around by using these ratios of $\pi$
#### Finding Coordinate points defined by ratios of $\pi$.

Take the point $\frac{\pi}{4}$ as example. the point $P$ defined by $\frac{\pi}{4}$ lies on the intersection between the unit circle $x^{2}+y^{2}=1$ and the line $y=x$. So if we substitute $x$ for $y$ in the equation of the circle we get:
$$\begin{align*}
x^{2}+y^{2}&= 1\\
x^{2}+x^{2}&= 1\\
2x^{2}&= 1\\
x^{2}&= \frac{1}{2}\\
x&= \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}\\
x&= \pm\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
\end{align*}$$
Since $y=x$ then the point is $P(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})$.
