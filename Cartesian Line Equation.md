With [[Parametric Line Equation|parametric lines]] we use a [[vault/content/S1/AVLC/Vector|vector]] and a point to determine the line. As such:
$$\begin{align*}
x&= x_{0}+at\\
y&= y_{0}+bt
\end{align*}$$
Where $x_{0},y_{0}$ are constants and $t\in \mathbb{R}$ is the parameter.
We can eliminate the parameter by multiplying the upper equation by $b$ and the bottom by $a$ and subtract them to obtain $ay-bx=ay_{0}-bx_{0}$. Noticing the second member is a constant, we replace it by $c$:
$$\begin{align*}
ay-bx=c
\end{align*}$$
Which is called the **Cartesian Equation** of the line $r$. if $a\ne 0$ we can divide the equation by $a$ and get $$y=\frac{b}{a}x + \frac{c}{a}$$By letting $m=\frac{b}{a}$ and $k = \frac{c}{a}$ we have: $y=mx+k$
