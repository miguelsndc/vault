We say that the limit of $f(x)$ is $L$ as $x$ approaches $a$ and write it as:
$$\begin{align*}
\lim_{x\to a}f(x) =L
\end{align*}$$
We can make $f(x)$ as close to $L$ as we want for all $x$ sufficiently close to $a$, from both sides **without letting $x$ be $a$**.
The [[Functions|function]] does not care about what is happening at $x=a$, all that matters is whatever the fuck is happening around $a$ with $x<a$ or $x>a$ as we approach $a$.

>For a limit to exist the function must be settling down in towards a single value as we get closer to the point in question.
