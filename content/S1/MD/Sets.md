A set is a un-ordered collection of objects.
Objects contained in a set are called **elements**, we say they **belong** to the set.
$$\begin{align*}
V&= \{a, e,i,o,u\}\\
O&= \{x\in \mathbb{Z}^{+} \mid 2\mod x =1\}
\end{align*}$$
Two sets are equal if and only if they have the exact same elements:
$$\begin{align*}
A=B \iff \forall x(x\in A \iff x \in B)
\end{align*}$$

Order and  number os appearances of a element **does not matter** to the equality.
$$\{1, 2, 3\}=\{1,1,2,2,3,1,2,3,1,2\}$$
