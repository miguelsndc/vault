A [[Polynomials|polynomial]] synthetic division is a quick method to divide two polynomials, but the **divisor** must be $x - c$, otherwise use [[Polynomial Long Division Algorithm|long division]] instead. It's kind of a weird mechanism so check your notebook bro.

Just remember that the quotient is **one degree lower** than the dividend, and the remainder is the **rightmost** entry at the bottom.
