The **graph** of a equation in $x$ and $y$ is the set of all points $(x,y)$ in the [[Coordinate Plane]] that satisfy the [[Equation]].

#### Sketch a Graph by Plotting Points

> Sketch the graph of the equation $2x-y=3$ 
1. We first solve the equation for $y$ to get $y = 2x-3$, then we calculate the y-coordinates for x.

| $x$ | $y =2x-3$ | $(x,y)$ |
| --- | --------- | ------- |
| -1  | -5        | (-1,5)  |
| 0   | -3        | (0,-3)  |
| 1   | -1        | (1,-1)  |
| 2   | 1         | (2,1)   |
| 3   | 3         | (3,3)   |
| 4   | 5         | (4,5)   | 

And finally we get the graph:
