This theorem states that if a [[Polynomials|polynomial]] is divided by $x - c$ (check [[Synthetic Divison|synthetic division]]), Then the remander is the value of $P(c)$, See:
$$\begin{align*}
P(x)&= D(x) \cdot Q(x) + r\\
P(x) &= (x - c) \cdot Q(x) + r\\
P(c) &= (c-c) \cdot Q(x) +r\\\\
P(c) &= 0\cdot Q(x) +r\\ &= 0+r \\
&= r


\end{align*}$$It's hence proved that the value of $P(c)$ is the remainder.
