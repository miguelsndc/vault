Co-terminal angles are those who end at the same place

![[Excalidraw__Co Terminal Positive Angles]]

Co-terminal angles can be found by either adding or subtracting 360º.

Let 1200º be our target angle. We can subtract 360º until we have a angle that is represented in the [[Trigonometric Circle]].  
$$
\begin{align*}
1200-360 &= 840\\
840 -360 &= 480\\
480 -360 &= 120
\end{align*}
$$

120 is indeed present in the trigonometric circle. **1200º , 840º , 480º , 120º** are all Co terminal angles and share properties with the **120º** angle.

## In Radians

Radian angles can also be found in the [[Trigonometric Circle]]

![[Excalidraw__ Co Terminal Angles (Radians).excalidraw]]

We can get a co terminal angle by adding or subtracting 2$\pi$ from a radian. observe this example:
$$\begin{align*}
2\pi + \frac{\pi}{6} &= \frac{12\pi}{6} + \frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{13\pi}{6}
\end{align*}$$

$\frac{13\pi}{6}$ is a co-terminal angle of $\frac{\pi}{6}$. 

We can also back up another turn and subtract the 2$\pi$.
$$\begin{align*}
\frac{\pi}{6}- 2\pi &= \frac{-11\pi}{6}
\end{align*}$$
