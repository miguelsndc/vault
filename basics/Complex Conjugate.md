The complex conjugate of a complex number is the number itself with the sign of the imaginary part switched.
*e.g.*
$$\begin{align*}
z &= a+bi\\
\overline{z} &= a - bi
\end{align*}$$
Note that:
$$\begin{align*}
z \cdot \overline{z} &= (a+bi)(a-bi)= a^{2}+b^2
\end{align*}$$
Remember the Difference of Squares from [[Special Factoring Formulas]], but note that $i^{2} = -1$, so $a^{2} - (b^{2}(-1)) = a^{2}-(-b^{2}) = a^{2}+b^{2}$. So the product of [[Complex Numbers]] and their conjugate is always nonnegative [[Real Numbers]].
