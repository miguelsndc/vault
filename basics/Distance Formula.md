The Distance formula for $d(A,B)$ for $A(x_{1},y_{1})$ and $B(x_{2}, y_{2})$ is:
$$\begin{align*}
d(A,B)&= \sqrt{(x_{2}-x_{1})^{2}+(y_{2}-y_{1})^{2}}
\end{align*}$$

### Proof

To find the distance $d(A,B)$ between any arbirtrary points $A(x_{1},y_{1})$ and $B(x_{2},y_{2})$ in the [[Coordinate Plane]], we first need to recall that the distance between numbers $a$ and $b$ in the real line is denoted by: $d(a,b)=\mid b-a\mid$.

From the figure above we see that the distance between points $A(x_{1},y_{1})$ and $C(x_{2},y_{1})$ is $| \; x_{2}- x_{1} \; |$, and the distance between $B(x_{2},y_{2})$ and $C$ is $|\; y_{2} - y_{1} \; |$, Since it forms a right triangle, from the Pythagorean Theorem we have:   
$$\begin{align*}
h^{2}&= a^2+b^{2}\\
d^{2}&= |\; x_{2}-x_{1}\;|^{2}+ |\;y_{2}-y_{1}|^2\\
d(a,b)&= \sqrt{(x_{2}-x_{1})^{2}+(y_{2}-y_{1})^{2}}
\end{align*}$$
Therefore, the distance $d$ between points $A$ and $B$ in the [[Coordinate Plane]] is:
$$\begin{align*}
d(A,B)&= \sqrt{(x_{2}-x_{1})^{2}+(y_{2}-y_{1})^{2}}
\end{align*}$$
