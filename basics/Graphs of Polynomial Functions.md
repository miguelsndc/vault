The [[Graph of a Function|graph]] of a [[Polynomial Functions|polynomial function]] is not as predictable as the graph of a [[Quadratic Function]] for example, but it follows that:
> It's continuous; A **smooth curve**, there's no breaks, holes, corners or sharp points in a polynomial graph, it's kinda of like a wave, it's actually quite poetic.

The [[Domain|domain]] of a polynomial is the set of all [[Real Numbers]], but we are quite limited with that, To describe how a polynomial might behave when **approaching infinity** we use the [[End Behavior of a Polynomial]] defition with some fancy shit to deal with
