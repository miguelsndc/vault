A Function $f$ whose [[Domain|domain]] and [[Codomain]] are [[Subsets]] of the [[content/S1/MD/Sets|set]] of [[Real Numbers]] is called *increasing* if $f(x) \le f(y)$, and *strictly increasing* if $f(x) \lt f(y)$, whenever $x \lt y$ and **$x$ and $y$ are in the domain of $f$**.
Similarly, $f$ is called *decreasing* if $f(x) \ge f(y)$, and *strictly decreasing* whenever $f(x) \gt f(y)$ whenever $x\lt y$ and $x$ and $y$ are in the domain of $f$.
- Increasing: $\forall x \forall y(x \lt y \implies f(x) \le f(y))$
- Strictly increasing: $\forall x \forall y(x \lt y \implies f(x) \lt f(y))$
- Decreasing: $\forall x \forall y(x \lt y \implies f(x) \ge f(y))$
- Strictly decreasing: $\forall x \forall y(x \lt y \implies f(x) \gt f(y))$

From these definitions it's possible to show that **a function that is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing must be [[Injective Functions|one-to-one]]**, However, a function that is increasing but no strictly increasing, or a function that is decreasing but no strictly decreasing **is not one-to-one.**
