Look at this triangle:

We quickly see that it's a equilateral triangle of $60\times60\times60\degree$. meaning all sides are equal, So we can already derive that:
$$\begin{align*}
2b &= 1\\
b &= \frac{1}{2}\\
\sin{30\degree} &= \frac{1}{2}\\
\cos{60\degree} &= \frac{1}{2} 
\end{align*}$$
We can find the [[Sine and Cosine|sine]] of $60\degree$ and the [[Sine and Cosine|cosine]] of $30\degree$ by the pythagorean theorem:
$$\begin{align*}
a^{2}+\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2} &= 1\\
a^{2} + \frac{1}{4}&= 1\\
a ^{2}&= \frac{3}{4}\\
a&= \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\end{align*}$$
From this we have $\sin{60\degree} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $\cos{30\degree} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}$, We could
