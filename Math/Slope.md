Is the rise divided by the run. the rate of change of a function.
e.g.
$$\begin{align*}
m &= \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{(y_{2}-y_1)}{(x_2-x_{1})}=\frac{rise}{run}
\end{align*}$$
- We have a vertical line when $m$ = 0 and vice-versa.
- With a 45ยบ angle we have a slope of approximately 1.
- The $run$ or the $\Delta y$ must always be positive.
- With a **vertical line** the $m$ is $\infty$ or undefined. 

The slope can be found if we have at least **two** ordered pairs available.
Let $p$ be $(2, 5)$ and $P$ be $(5, 14)$.

Therefore, the slope $m$ will be:
$$\begin{align*}
m &= \frac{14-5}{5-2}=\frac{9}{3}=3.
\end{align*}$$
