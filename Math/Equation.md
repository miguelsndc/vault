A equation is a statement that two mathematical expressions are true:
$e.g.$
$$\begin{align*}
3+5&= 8\\
4x+7&= 19
\end{align*}$$
The letter $x$ is called a **variable**, our goal is to find a value for $x$ that makes the equation true, the [[Properties of Equality]] holds for equations.

It's often necessary to solve a equation of multiple variables in terms of others, therefore we isolate the variable we want to find the value of, and treat the others as numbers.
