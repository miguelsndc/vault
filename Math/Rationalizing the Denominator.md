It is often useful to eliminate the [[Radicals]] in a denominator by multiplying both numerator and denominator by an appropriate expression. This process is called **rationalizing the denominator**, if the denominator is of the form $\sqrt{a}$ we multiply numerator and denominator by $\sqrt{a}$. When doing this, by the [[Properties of Fractions]], we are multiplying the given quantity by 1, therefore not changing its value.

$e.g.$
$$\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}\cdot1=\frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}\cdot \frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{a}}=\frac{\sqrt{a}}{a}
\end{align*}$$
