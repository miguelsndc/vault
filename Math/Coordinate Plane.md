The coordinate plane is a link between algebra and geometry, we can now draw graphs of any [[Algebraic Expressions]]. To represent a coordinate plane *(or Cartesian plane)* we draw two [[Perpendicular]] lines that cross at *origin $O$*. The vertical line is called the **y-axis** and the horizontal **x-axis**. These two axes divide the plane into four **quadrants**, labeled, **I, II, III, IV**, counter clockwise.
Any point $P$ in the coordinate plane can be located using a unique **ordered pair** $(a, b)$, the first number $a$ is called the **x-coordinate** and the second number $b$ is called the **y-coordinate**
