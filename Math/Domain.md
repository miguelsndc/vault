The domain $D$ of a function $f$ is the list of all possible $x$ values that can exist for this function. Can be written using [[Set Builder Notation]].

> $x$ values that yield undefined results **are not** part of the domain of the function. Therefore, if a function $f$ has fractions os square roots (or both), find $x$ values that yield negative roots or 0 as denominator and exclude them from the domain.

If a function $f$ is just a regular polynomial function without square roots or fractions, the domain $D$ of $f$ is $D(-\infty, +\infty)$.
