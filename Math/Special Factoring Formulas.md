The inverse of [[Special Product Formulas]]

1. $A^2-B^2=(A+B)(A-B)$ 
2. $A^2+2AB+B^2=(A+B)^2$
3. $A^2-2AB+B^2=(A-B)^2$
4. $A^{3}-B^{3}=(A-B)(A^2+AB+B^2)$    
5. $A^{3}+B^{3}=(A+B)(A^2-AB+B^2)$

>We recognize a perfect square *(formula 2/3)* if the middle term $2AB$ or $-2AB$ is plus or minus twice the product of the square roots of the outer two terms.

We start factoring by looking at the [[Greatest Common Factor]] and factoring out with the *smallest exponent*, and then proceeding with the formulas above.

Polynomials can also be factored using [[Factor by Grouping terms]].
