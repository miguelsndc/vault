We can sketch a symmetric graph by just plotting the points for only positive on negative points and then reflect it about the symmetric axis
#### Types of Symmetry

1. **Symmetric with respect to the y-axis**
	If whenever the point $(x,y)$ is on the graph, then so is $(-x, y)$. This means that the graph remains unchanged when reflected about the **x-axis**. To verify, replace $x$ with $-x$ in the equation and the result is equivalent to the original one. $f(x) = f(-x)$

1. **Symmetric with respect to the x-axis**
	If whenever the point $(x,y)$ is on the graph, then so is $(x,-y)$.  This means that the graph remains unchanged when reflected about the **y-axis**. Replace $y$ with $-y$ and the resulting equation is equivalent to the original one.

1. **Symmetric with respect to the origin**
	If whenever the point $(x,y)$ is on the graph, then so is $(-x, -y)$. It means that the graph remains unchanged when rotated 180ยบ about the origin. Replace $x$ with $-x$ and $y$ with $-y$ and the result is equivalent to the original equation. $f(-x) = -f(x)$
