#trigonometry 

To convert between [[Radians]] and Degrees we can think of a proportion.

A radian $r$ divided by half of the circle, which is $\pi$. 
A degree $d$ divided by $180 º$, which is half of the circle as well. 
They are equivalent. So,
$$\begin{align*}
\frac{r}{\pi}&= \frac{d}{180º}
\end{align*}$$
Let $\frac{7\pi}{9}$ be our angle.
$$\begin{align*}
\frac{\frac{7\pi}{9}}{\pi} &= \frac{d}{180º} \\
\frac{7}{9} &=\frac{d}{180º} \\
\frac{1260º}{9}&= d \\
d =140 º 
\end{align*}$$
