#algebra

A equation that represents a line within a graph.
Can be written as:
$y = mx + b$ where $m$ is the [[Slope]] and b is the y intercept (See [[Linear Interceptions]])
$ax + by = c$  $\rightarrow$ the standard form. $a$, $b$ and $c$ are all coefficients.
$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$  where $m$ is the slope.
