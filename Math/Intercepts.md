The x-coordinates of a point in a [[Coordinate Plane]] where a graph intersects the x-axis are called the **x-intercepts** of the graph and are obtained by setting y to 0 and solving the [[Equation]] for y. Same goes for the **y-intercepts**, instead, set x to 0 and solve for y.

We find the intercepts when we set the opposite axis to 0 due to the nature of the Cartesian plane, the x-axis represent the values of x and it's equation is y = 0. The y-axis represent the values of y and it's equation is x = 0. 
Taking x-intercept as example, when we find it we are essentially determining where the graph crosses this axis, meaning where the function output (y) becomes zero.
