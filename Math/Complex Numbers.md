A complex number is an expression of the form $a +bi$ where $a$ and $b$ are [[Real Numbers]]
and $i^{2} = -1$. The **real part** of this complex number is $a$ and the **imaginary part** is $bi$.

Two complex numbers are equal if and only if their real and imaginary part are equal.

To perform arithmetic operations use the [[Operations on Complex Numbers]] rules.
