If a [[Rational Expressions]] has a denominator of the form $A + B\sqrt{C}$, we can [[Rationalize the Denominator]], by multiplying both numerator and denominator by the **conjugate radical** $A -B\sqrt{C}$. This works because of [[Special Product Formulas]] 1, the product of a radical and its conjugate does not contain a radical:
$e.g.$
$$\begin{align*}
(A+B\sqrt{C})(A-B\sqrt{C}) &= A^{2}-B^2C
\end{align*}$$
