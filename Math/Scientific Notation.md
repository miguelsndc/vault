Scientific notation is a technique used to represent extremely large numbers as a small numbers multiplying powers of 10. $e.g.$
A Positive numbers $x$ is said to be written in scientific notation if it's expressed as follows:
$$\begin{align*}
x &= a \times 10^{n} \;\; \text{where} \;\; 1\le a\le10 \;\;\text{and} \;\; n\in \mathbb{Z}
\end{align*}$$
For instance, *Proxima Centauri* is the closest star to the sun and it is $4\times10^{13}$ km away. We are say that the decimal point should be moved 13 places to the right:
$$\begin{align*}
 4\times10^{13}&= 40,000,000,000,000
\end{align*}$$

When we state that the mass of a hydrogen atom is $1.66\times10^{-24}g$ the exponent $-24$ indicates that the decimal point should be moved 24 places to the left
$$\begin{align*}
1.66\times10^{-24}&= 0.00000000000000000000000166
	\end{align*}$$
