Scientific notation is a technique used to represent extremely large numbers as a small numbers multiplying powers of 10. $e.g.$
A Positive numbers $x$ is said to be written in scientific notation if it's expressed as follows:
$$\begin{align*}
x &= a \times 10^{n} \;\; \text{where} \;\; 1\le a\le10 \;\;\text{and} \;\; n\in \mathbb{Z}
\end{align*}$$
For instance, *Proxima Centauri* is the closest star to the sun and it is 40,000,000,000,000 km away. We can represent in scientific notation as:
$$\begin{align*}
40,000,000,000,000 &= 4\times10^{13}
\end{align*}$$
Where $13$ is indicates that the decimal point should be moved 13 places to the right.
