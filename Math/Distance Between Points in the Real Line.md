The distance $d$ between points $a$ and $b$ in the real line is $\mid b - a \mid$.
Following the notation:
$$\begin{align*}
d(a,b) &=  |b - a|
\end{align*}$$
As shown in Property 6 of [[Properties of Negatives]]: $| a - b | = | b - a |$.

$e.g.$ The distance between points $2$ and $-8$ in the real line is:

$$\begin{align*}
d(a,b) &= | b - a | \ \text{or}\ | a - b| =| 2-(-8) | = |-10| = 10   
\end{align*}$$
