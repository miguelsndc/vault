To factor [[Polynomials]] of the form $x^{2}+bx+c$, we note that
$$\begin{align*}
(x+r)(x+s)=x^{2}+(r+s)x+rs
\end{align*}$$
So we need to choose numbers $r$ and $s$ such that $r+s = b$ and $rs = c$

To factor a trinomial of the form $ax^2+bx+c$ where $a\ne1$ we look for factor of the form $(px+r)$ and $(qx+s)$:
$$\begin{align*}
ax^2+bx+c=pqx^{2}+(ps+qr)x+rs
\end{align*}$$
Therefore if we try to find these numbers $p,q,r$ and $s$ such that $pq = a$, $rs=c$ $ps+qr=b$. If these numbers are all integers, then we will have a limited number of possibilities to try for $p,q,r$ and $s$.
