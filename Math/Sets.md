A set is a collection of objects, and these objects are called **elements**.
If $S$ is a set and $a$ is a object of this set, the notation is:
$$\begin{align*}
a \in S
\end{align*}$$
If $b$ is not in $S$, we can write it as:
$$\begin{align*}
b \notin S
\end{align*}$$
Some sets can be written within braces like, for example, set $A$ that consists of all positive integers up to 7.
$$\begin{align*}
A &= \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}
\end{align*}$$
Or with the [[Set-Builder Notation]].

The **empty set**, denoted by the symbol ${\emptyset}$, is the set that contains no elements.
