If a [[Quadratic Equation]] does not factor readily, we can solve it by **completing the square**.
This means to add a constant to an expression to make it a perfect square.

To make $ax^{2} +bx$ a perfect square, add $(\frac{b}{2a})^{2}$, the square of half of the coefficient $b$ of $x$. This yields the perfect square:
$$ax^{2}+bx+(\frac{b}{2a})^{2}= (x + \frac{b}{2a})^{2}$$
