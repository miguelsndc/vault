Fractional exponents such as $a^\frac{1}{3}$ are dismistified using [[Radicals]], to give meaning to $a^{\frac{1}{n}}$ in a way that's consistent with the [[Laws of Exponents]] we would have to have:
$$\begin{align*}
(a^{\frac{1}{n}})^{n} &= a^{(\frac{1}{n})n}=a^{1}=a
\end{align*}$$
By the [[Definition of the nth root]]:
$$
\begin{align*}
a^{\frac{1}{n}} &= \sqrt[n]{a}
\end{align*}
$$
