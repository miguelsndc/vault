 The simbol $\sqrt{\;\;\;}$ means "the positive square root of". Thus
$$
\begin{align*}
\sqrt{a} &= b \;\;\;\ \text{means} \;\;\; b^{2}=a \;\;\; \text{and}\;\;\; b\ge0
\end{align*}
$$
Square roots are a special case of $n$th roots. The $n$th root of $x$ is the number that, when raised to the $n$th power yields $x$, following:

If $n$ is any positive integer, than the **principal $n$th root** of $a$ is defined as follows:
$$\begin{align*}
\sqrt[n]{a} &= b \iff b^{n}=a
\end{align*}$$

Operations involving radicals must follow the [[Properties of nth roots]].
