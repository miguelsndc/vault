A Quadratic [[Equation]] is a second-degree equations of the form:
$$\begin{align*}
ax^2+bx+c=0
	\end{align*}$$Quadratic equations can be solved in many ways:
1. [[Factoring Trinomials]], and by using the [[Zero Product Property]].
2. [[Completing the Square]] 
3. [[The Quadratic Formula]] 

With equations involving [[Rational Expressions]] or [[Radicals]], we must check the solutions against the original expression, they are only *potential* solutions, math is fucked. Called technically *Extraneous Solutions*.
