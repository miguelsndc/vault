A rational expression is a fractional expression which both numerator and denominator are [[Polynomials]].

The [[Domain]] of a rational expression is the set of values the expression is allowed to have.

Operations with rational expression are done the same way as regular fractions, with [[Properties of Fractions]], all four basic operations and simplification.

To sum and subtract, you need to find the **Least Common Denominator**, which is found by factoring the denominator, and taking the product of the distinct factors and using the highest power that shows up.
