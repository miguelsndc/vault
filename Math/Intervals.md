Intervals correspond geometrically to line segments. 

if $a$ < $b$, then the **Open Interval** from $a$ to $b$ consists of all numbers between $a$ and $b$ is denoted $(a, b)$. 
The **closed interval** between $a$ and $b$ *includes the endpoints* and is denoted $[a, b]$.

Using [[Set Builder Notation]] we can write:
$$\begin{align*}
(a, b) &= \{x \ | \ a < x < b\}\\
[a, b] &= \{ x \ | \ a \le x \le b \}
\end{align*}$$
Intervals can also be represented with graphs. (See [[Graph of Intervals]].)

- Before operating on intervals, represent both together and work around it.
