Vertical stretching and shrinking are a transformation we can apply to make the $y$-values of a function more extreme, making it look like it "stretched" or "shrinked". 
Suppose we have a [[Functions|function]] $y=f(x)$, and a constant $c$. Note:
- if $y=cf(x)$ where $0< c < 1$ we are **shrinking** the [[Graph of a Function|graph]] of $y$, because multiplying a value by some other value smaller than $1$, makes the outputs smaller, therefore de
