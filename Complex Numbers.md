Humanity's best try to deal with negative square roots, introduces the $i$ "number" to accomplish it.

### Definition
We know that if $a$ and $b$ are both positive, then $\sqrt{ab} = \sqrt{a}\sqrt{b}$. Therefore we can write any negative square root $a$ as:
$$
\sqrt{-a} = \sqrt{(a)(-1)} = \sqrt{a}\sqrt{-1}
$$
At this point we can't do anything else about the $\sqrt{-1}$, so we just replace it with $i$.
Note that:
$$
\sqrt{-1} = i \iff i^{2}=-1
$$ $e.g$ 
$$\begin{align*}
\sqrt{-9} &= 3i\\
\sqrt{-290} &= \sqrt{290} \ i \\
\end{align*}$$

#### Standard Form
The **standard form** of a complex number is written as:
$$\begin{align*}
a + bi
\end{align*}$$
Where $a$ and $b$ are both real numbers. In the standard form, $a$ is called the **real** part of the complex number and $b$ is called the **imaginary** part of the complex number.

#### Conjugate

The conjugate of a complex number is just itself with the sign "+/-" of the imaginary part switched. 

Let $z = a + bi$ be a positive complex number, the conjugate of $z$ or $\overline{z}$ will be the complex number: $z = a - bi$. So as represented by the relation:
 $$
z = a + bi\ \implies \overline{z} = a - bi
$$
