Unlike regular [[Intuitive Definition of Limits|limits]] where we need to check both directions *($x<a$ and $x>a$)*, with one-sided limits we only look at one direction, either right or left. See:
##### Right-handed Limit
We say
$$\begin{align*}
\lim_{x\to a^{+}}f(x)=L
\end{align*}$$
To make $f(x)$ as close to $L$ as we want for all $x$ sufficiently close to $a$ with $x > a$. Note the $+$ sign in "$a^{+}$".
##### Left-handed Limit
We say
$$\begin{align*}
\lim_{x\to a^{-}}f(x)=L
\end{align*}$$
To make $f(x)$ as close to $L$ as we want for all $x$ sufficiently close to $a$ with $x < a$. Note the $+$ sign in "$a^{-}$".

>It's really easy to mess this up if not paying attention since the notation is very subtle, make sure to always check the bottom part of the $\lim$ part to know with what fucked up shit we are working with.
