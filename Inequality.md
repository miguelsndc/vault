Some problems in algebra lead to inequalities instead of a [[Equation]]s, a inequality behaves similarly to a equation, but, instead of the equal sign, we use the following symbols: $\lt,\gt,\le,\ge$, meaning, respectively, *Less than, Greater than, Less or Equals, Greater or Equals*. 

Unlike equations, inequalities have infinetly many results, which forms a interval or a union of intervals in the real line. To **solve** a inequality, we must find all values that make the inequality true.
$$\begin{align*}
4x + 7 &= 19 \;\; x=3 \\
4x + 7 &\le 19\;\; x\le 3
\end{align*}$$
