A Trapezoid is a quadrilateral with exactly one,,,,,,,, pair of parallel sides.
##### Properties
- The two non-parallel sides are called **legs**
- The parallel sides are called the **bases**, where the longer one is called the **upper base**, and the shorter one is the **lower base**
#### Formulas for Area and Perimeter 
- Area: $\frac{1}{2}s \times h$ where $s$ is the sum of the lengths of the bases and $h$ is the height.  
- Perimiter is $s$ where $s$ is the sum of the lengths of the bases.
