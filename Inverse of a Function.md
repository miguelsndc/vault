#### Definition
Let $f$ be a [[One-to-One Functions|one-to-one function]] with a [[Domain|domain]] $A$ and [[Range|range]] $B$. Then it's **inverse** [[Functions|function]] $f^{-1}$ has domain $B$ and range $A$ and is defined by:
$$\begin{align*}
f^{-1}(y) &= x \iff f(x)=y
\end{align*}$$
This states that if $f$ takes $x$ to $y$, then $f^{-1}$ takes $y$ to $x$, this would not be possible if $f$ weren't a one-to-one, $f^{-1}$ would not be uniquely defined, hence not being a function.

**DO NOT MISTAKE** the $-1$ in $f^{-1}$ for an exponent, $f^{-1}(x) \ne \frac{1}{f(x)}$, The reciprocal of $f(x)$ is written as $(f(x))^{-1}$.
