We can determine a [[vault/content/S1/AVLC/Vector|vector]] that is simultaneously perpendicular to two other vectors. We can do so by putting the two vectors in a determinant with the [[Canonical Vectors]] and working through it. 

Curiously the [[vault/content/S1/AVLC/Vector Norm|magnitude]] of the cross product is exactly equal to the area of the [[vault/content/basics/Parallelogram|Parallelogram]]formed by the other two vectors, hence this operation is extremely useful to calculate areas, but finding perpendicular vectors is a equally important operation. 

The operation is denoted by $u \times v$.

#### Properties

- Cross Product **is not** commutative. From the inner working of matrices we see that modifying one column or line in it changes the sign, Therefore:
$$\begin{align*}
u\times v \ne v \times u
\end{align*}$$
But if we change **two lines or two columns** we keep the same result, so:
$$\begin{align*}
u \times v&= -v\time
\end{align*}$$
