Two propositions $p$ and $q$ are equivalent if $p \iff q$ is a [[Tautology]]. The notation $p\equiv q$ denotes that $p$ and $q$ are equivalent.
The symbol $\equiv$ is not a logical connective, neither $p \equiv q$ is a [[Proposition]], the equivalence symbol $\equiv$ simply states that $p \iff q$ is a tautology. See [[Logical Equivalence Laws]]
