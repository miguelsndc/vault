Surjective or *onto* functions are those who every value $y$ in the [[Range|range]] has a associated value in the [[Domain|domain]], it means that there are no gaps between the [[Codomain|codomain]] and the [[Range in Discrete Math|range]] of the function. See:
$$\forall y \in \mathbb{Y} \; \exists x \in \mathbb{X} : f(x) = y $$
