A Function in discrete mathematics, just like in continuous mathematics is a rule that maps exactly one value in the [[Domain]] to another value in the [[Codomain]].
Denoted as $f: \mathbb{X} \implies \mathbb{Y}$ where the big $x$ is the domain and the big $y$ is the codomain (or range).

Let $f(x) = y$
- $x$ is called the *pre-image* of $y$
- $y$ is called the *image* of $x$

The [[Range in Discrete Math]] is the set of all images of $f$.
