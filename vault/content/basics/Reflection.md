To reflect a [[Functions|function]] over a arbitrary axis we mean to transpose the function, or "mirror", over the desired axis. To get the reflection over $x$, negate $y$ and vice-versa, it's the opposite of one might expect.
- To reflect over the $y$-axis, we must **negate $x$** because the function should be on the opposite side of $y$ of where it was initially.
- To reflect over the $x$-axis, we must **negate $y$** in order to obtain a function that transposes this axis. For every positive $y$, the function is above the $x$-axis, to reflect it, negate $y$, so we can get a function that shows up in the opposite side of the $x$.
