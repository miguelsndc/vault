#### Definition 
A function $f$ is a rule that assigns to each element $x$ in a set $A$ exactly one element, called $f(x)$, in a set $B$.

The set $A$ is called the [[Domain]] of the function. The [[Range]] of $f$ is the set of all possible values of $f(x)$ as $x$ varies throughout the domain, that means:
$$\begin{align*}
\text{range of } f&= \{f(x) \;|\; x \in A\}
\end{align*}$$
The symbol that represents an arbitrary number in the **domain** of $f$ is called a **independent** variable. The symbol that represents an arbitrary number in the **range** of $f$ is called a **dependent** variable.

If we think of functions as machines, If $x$ is the domain of the function, when it enters the machine, it is accepted as **input**, then the machine produces an output $f(x)$ according to the rule of the function. Thus, the domain is the set of all possible inputs and the range is the set of all possible outputs.
