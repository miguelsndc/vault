Since the circumference of the [[Unit Circle]] is $2\pi$, the terminal point $t$ is the same point determined by $t + 2\pi$ or $t-2\pi$, we're just giving a full turn and ending back on the same place, so, to find [[Terminal Points in the Unit Circle|terminal points]] for large $t$ values, eliminate the full turns by simplifying taking away the $2\pi$ how many times it appears. You'll end up with:
$$t = \text{full turns} + \text{actual terminal point}$$
