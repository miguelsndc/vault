Often regular propositional logic can't handle a wide variety of cases, that's why **predicate logic** exists. See the statement *"x > 3"*, we can't tell whether this is a proposition because we don't know the value of x.
We can actually produce propositions out of these statements, by creating subjects and predicates.

Let $p$ = $x \gt 3$
$p$ has two parts: "x"
