We have three types of symmetry:

1. **Symmetric with respect to the y-axis**
	If whenever the point $(x,y)$ is on the graph, then so is $(-x, y)$. This means that the graph remains unchanged when reflected about the **x-axis**. To veeplace $x$ with $-x$ in the equation, and it should be equivalent to the original one.

1. **Symmetric with respect to the x-axis**
	If whenever the point $(x,y)$ is on the graph, then so is $(x,-y)$.

1. **Symmetric with respect to the origin**
	If whenever the point $(x,y)$ is on the graph, then so is $(-x, -y)$
