Since [[Conditional Statement]] play a essential role in mathematical reasoning, it's often used in a ton of different ways, some of them are not that obvious, but they all mean the same. $p \implies q$. See:
- "$p$ is sufficient for $q$"
- "$q$ if $p$"
- "$q$ when $p$"
- "a necessary condition for $p$ is $q$"
- "q unless $\neg p$"
- "$q$ whenever $p$"
- "$q$ is necessary for $p$"
- "$q$ follows from $p$"
