The trig functions are no more than rations of the sides of [[Right Triangle|right triangles]], since there are three sides, there's $3\times 2 = 6$ different ways to make a ratio. Sine and Cosine are the big ones, the other's are just **different combinations of sine and cosine**.

$\sin{A} =$ opposite side of $A$ divided by the *hypothenuse*.
$\cos{A}$ = adjacent side of $A$ divided by the *hypothenuse*.

Since $A+B+C =180$ and $C=90$, then $A+B = 90$, which can be rewritten as:
- $A= 90- B$
- $B = 90 - A$ 
When two angles add to $90\degree$ they are the **complement** of each other, and the sine of each angle is the **co**sine of the other.
These are the **cofunction identities**:
$$\begin{align*}
\sin{A} &= \cos{90\degree-A} \text{ or } \cos{\frac{\pi}{2}-A}\\
\cos{A} &= \sin{90\degree-A} \text{ or } \sin{\frac{\pi}{2}-A}
\end{align*}$$
