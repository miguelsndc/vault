The equation of a circle of with center $(h, k)$ and radius $r$ is , see: [[Graph of a Circle]]:
$$\begin{align*}
(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}&=r^2
\end{align*}$$
This is called the **standard form** of the circle, if the center is the origin $(0, 0)$, then it becomes:
$$\begin{align*}
x^{2}+y^{2}=r^{2}
\end{align*}$$

#### Deriving

By definition, a circle with center $C(h,k)$ and radius $r$ is the set of all points $P(x,y)$ whose distance from the center is the radius, $d(C,P) = r$, so, by the [[Distance Formula]] we have:
$$\begin{align*}
\sqrt{(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}}&= r\\
(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}&=r^2
\end{align*}$$
This is the desired equation.
