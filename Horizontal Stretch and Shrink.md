Horizontally stretching or shrink stands for a transformation that makes the [[Graph of a Function|graph of]] a [[Functions|function]] **wider** or **narrower** without changing the $y$-values of it.
Suppose we have $y=f(x)$, Note:
- To horizontally **shrink** it, we can multiply $x$ by a constant $c$ where $c \gt 1$, because if:
$$\begin{align*}
f(x)&= 1\\
f(2x) &= y\\
2x&= y\\
x&= \frac{y}{2}
\end{align*}$$
Here we are torning in half the original value of $x$, see that this doesn't alter the original value of $y$ for $x$, this just makes the $y$ value $c$ parts closer or further away from where it used to be. We are essentially multiplying the $y$ by a $\frac{1}{c}$ factor. the larger $c$ is, the smaller the factor, and the other way around too, See:
- To horizontally **stretch** it, we can multiply $x$ by a constant $c$ where $0 < c < 1$, because if:
$$\begin{align*}
f(x) &= y\\
f\left(\frac{1}{2}x\right)&= y\\
\frac{1}{2}x &= y\\
x&= 2y
\end{align*}$$
We can even make it simpler, by taking the previous defition and multiplying by $\frac{1}{c}$:
$$\begin{align*}
f(\frac{1}{2}x)&= y\\
\frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}}y=\frac{1}{1}\cdot \frac{2}{1}=2y
\end{align*}$$
See that now $y$ is **twice** as far from where it originally used to be.
