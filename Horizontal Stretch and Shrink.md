Horizontally stretching or shrink stands for a transformation that makes the [[Graph of a Function|graph of]] a [[Functions|function]] **wider** or **narrower** without changing the $y$-values of it.
Suppose we have $y=f(x)$, Note:
- To horizontally **shrink** it, we can multiply $x$ by a constant $c$ where $c \gt 1$, because if:
$$\begin{align*}
f(x) &\rightarrow (x, f(x))\\
f(cx) &\rightarrow (cx, f(cx))\\
\end{align*}$$
This would give us the desired $y$-value, but the $x$-value is wrong, therefore to get the correct $x$, we must divide $cx$ by $c$ to get the original $x$. By doing this we are keeping the $y$-value while pushing it $\frac{1}{c}$ units closer the the $y$-axis, see:
$$\begin{align*}
f(x) &\rightarrow (x,f(x))\\
f(cx) &\rightarrow (cx,f(cx)) \;\text{We don't want this!}\\
f(cx) &\rightarrow \left(\frac{x}{c}, f(cx)\right) \; \text{Now x is preserved}
\end{align*}$$
Now for every ordered-pair, $$
