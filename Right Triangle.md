A **Right triangle** is one that contains a right angle **90**ยบ. The long side, which must be opposite to the right angle, is called the **hypotenuse** and short sides are sometimes called legs.
The famous [[Pythagorean Theorem]] is a way to find the length of sides based of a simple ratio between the hypothenuse and the sides.
