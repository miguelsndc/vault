Similarly to [[Vertical Shift]], horizontal shift takes place when we add a constant $c$ to our input, instead of adding to the output, so it becomes $f(x+c)$.
- Adding a constant $c$ to $x$ in $f(x)$ so it becomes $f(x+c)$ shifts the [[Graph of a Function|graph]] to the **left**.
- Subtracting a constant $c$ from $x$ in $f(x)$ so it becomes $f(x-c)$ shifts the graph to the **right**.
It looks quite confusing, but let me make it clearer, if we have a function $f(x)$ that has a [[Intercepts|x-intercept]] of **4**, if we take $c=1$ from $f(x)$ to make it $f(x-1)$, we are saying the we took away one unit from the input, so the function
