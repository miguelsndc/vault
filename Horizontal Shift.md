Similarly to [[Vertical Shift]], horizontal shift takes place when we add a constant $c$ to our input, instead of adding to the output, so it becomes $f(x+c)$.
- Adding a constant $c$ to $x$ in $f(x)$ so it becomes $f(x+c)$ shifts the [[Graph of a Function|graph]] to the **left**.
- Subtracting a constant $c$ from $x$ in $f(x)$ so it becomes $f(x-c)$ shifts the graph to the **right**.
The process of finding horizontal shifts work similarly like finding the [[Intercepts|x-intercept]], we set the input of the function to zero. Let $f(x+3) = x^{2}$
$$\begin{align*}
f(x+3) &= x^{2}\\
f(x)&= (x+3)^{2}\\
x+3&= 0\\
x&= -3 \; \text{when y is 0, x will be -3}\\
& \text{so we are essentially moving the graph leftwards.}
\end{align*}$$
The same goes the other way around.
