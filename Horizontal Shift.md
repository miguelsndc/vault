Similarly to [[Vertical Shift]], horizontal shift takes place when we add a constant $c$ to our input, instead of adding to the output, so it becomes $f(x+c)$.
- Adding a constant $c$ to $x$ in $f(x)$ so it becomes $f(x+c)$ shifts the [[Graph of a Function|graph]] to the **left**.
- Subtracting a constant $c$ from $x$ in $f(x)$ so it becomes $f(x-c)$ shifts the graph to the **right**.
When we subtract a value $c$ from the input $x$, we are effectively saying that $f(x-c)$ needs to be $c$ units larger to provide the same output as $f(x)$, therefore making it go rightwards. And the same thing happens the other way around. if we add a value $c$ to $x$ in $f(x)$ we obtain $f(x+c)$, we are saying this functions output needs to be $c$ units **smaller** to obtain the same output as $f(x)$.
