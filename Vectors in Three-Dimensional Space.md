Consider a rectangular coordinate system.

Let $\vec{a} = \{a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}\}$ be arbitrary vector and $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ be two points with coordinates $(x_{1},y_{1},z_{1})$ and $(x_{2},y_{2},z_{2})$, chosen to satisfy: $a_{1}=(x_{2}-x_{1})$, $a_{2}=(y_{2}-y_{1})$ and $a_{3}=(z_{2}-z_{1})$.

Therefore a vector $\vec{a}$ can be interpreted as the **line segment** between points $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$.
