#algebra #sets

Let $S$ and $m$ be arbitrary values for set names and variable names. See:

> $S$ = { $m$ | $m$ <*constraints*> }

Where <*constraints*> will define the bounds of the set.

$e.g.$
*$A$ = { $x$ | $x \in \mathbb{Z},$ 0 < $x$ < 7}*

Which is read as: "$A$ is the set of all $x$ such that $x$ is a integer and 0 < $x$ < 7"
