Degrees and Radians are different ways to measure angles. In radians we use a ratio of $\pi$, and with degrees we simply use numbers.

The most famous use case of these measures relies on measuring the [[Unit Circle|unit circle]]. By convention, a full turn in a circle is $360\degree$ or $2\pi$. So it follows that half a turn is $180\degree$ and $\pi$, respectively.
#### Converting one from another
To convert from degrees to radians and vice-versa we remember our ratio $180\degree = \pi$. 
Let's derive the conversion of $\frac{3\pi}{4}$ to degrees, you probably guessed that we need to multiply the top part by $180$, and that's correct.
$$\begin{align*}
\frac{3\pi}{4}\cdot 180&= \frac{540\pi}{4}
\end{align*}$$
But we also need to drop the $\pi$ here, so:
$$\begin{align*}
\frac{540\pi}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{\pi}
\end{align*}$$
