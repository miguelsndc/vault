Suppose that $f:A \rightarrow B$.
- **To show that $f$ is [[Injective Functions|injective]]**: Show that if $f(x) = f(y)$ for arbitrary $x,y \in A$ with $x\ne y$, then $x=y$; 
- To show that $f$ is **not** [[Injective Functions|injective]]: Find particular elements $x,y \in A$ such that $x \ne y$ and $f(x) = f(y)$.
- **To show that $f$ is [[Surjective Functions|surjective]]**: Consider a arbitrary element $y \in B$  and find element $x \in A$ such that $f(x) = y$;
- To show that $f$ is **not** [[Surjective Functions|surjective]]: Find a particular $y \in B$ such that $f(x) \ne y$ for all $x \in A$.
