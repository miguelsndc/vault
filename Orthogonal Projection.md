Recalling the orthogonality concepts in [[Orthogonality Between Vectors]], we say that two [[Vector|vectors]] are orthogonal between each other if their [[Scalar Product]] is $0$, the direct consequence of a $0$ scalar product is a $90\degree$ angle between the vectors.

If i have two non-orthogonal vectors $u$ and $v$, and want to *orthogonally project* $u$ over $v$, this means, finding a vector $w$ that's multiple of $v$ *(has same direction and orientation)*, such as when we do $u - w$ we get a new vector that is orthogonal to $v$. See:
