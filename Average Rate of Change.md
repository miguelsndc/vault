The average rate of change of a [[Functions|function]] $y=f(x)$ between $x=a$ and $x=b$ is:
$$\begin{align*}
\text{average rate of change}&= \frac{\text{change in y}}{\text{change in x}}=\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a}
\end{align*}$$
The average rate of change is the [[Average Rate of Change|slope]] of the secant line between $(a, f(a))$ and $(b,f(b))$. The numerator is the [[Net Change|net change]] in the value of $f$ between $x=a$ and $x=b$.
