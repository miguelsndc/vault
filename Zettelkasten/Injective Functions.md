A [[Functions in Discrete Math|function]] is $f$ is said to be *one-to-one*, or a **injunction**, if and only if $f(a) = f(b)$ implies that $a=b$ for all $a$ and $b$ in the domain of $f$. A function is said to be **injective** if it's one-to-one. See:
$$\forall a\forall b(f(a)=f(b) \implies a=b)$$
or the [[Contrapositive]]:
$$
\forall a \forall b(a\ne b \implies f(a) \ne f(b))
$$
