Let $\epsilon$ be the *canonical [[basis]]* of the [[Euclidean Space]], these [[Vector|vectors]],  $e_{1}, e_{2},e_{3}$ *span* the space because every vector in that space can be expressed as a [[Linear (In)dependence.|linear]] combination of these vectors.
The span of a [[Sets|set]] of vectors denoted $\spn{}$
