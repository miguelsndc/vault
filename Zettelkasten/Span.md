A [[Vector Space]] or [[Linear Subspaces|subspace]] $V$ is *spanned* by a [[Sets|set]] of [[Vector|vectors]] $S = \{v_{1},v_{2},\cdots,v_{n}\}$, [[If and Only if|if and only if]] $\span(S) = V$, if so, then every vector in that space can be written as a [[Linear Combinations|linear combination]] of $S$. If those vectors are linearly [[Linear (In)dependence.|independent]] then this set is called a [[basis]], otherwise, just a *spanning set* of $V$.   
For example, two linearly independent vectors span a [[Plane]] and three .
There's infinetly many spanning sets for the same space, as well as infinitely many [[basis]].
Let $$
V= \Bigg\{(x,y,z,w) \in R^{4}\mid \begin{cases}
x+y+z=0 \\
2x-y-w=0 \\
\end{cases}
\Bigg\}
$$
