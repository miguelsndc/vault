a matrix is a table of elements disposed in lines and columns, they are essential to organize and solve problems with a enormous amount of variables.
We denote a matrix $A$ with $m$ rows and $n$ columns like following: $A_{m\times n}$.
The elements of a matrix can be [[Functions|functions]], [[Real Numbers]] or [[Complex Numbers]], pretty much anything. $e.g.$
$$\begin{align*}
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots  & a_{1n}\\
a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots  & a_{2n}\\
a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \cdots  & a_{mn}
\end{bmatrix}\\
\end{align*}$$
Every element in a matrix can be described by a pair on indexes, each meaning row and column, respectively, like $[a_{ij}]_{m\times n}$.
