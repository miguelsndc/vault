Is a relationship of two [[Proposition|propositions]] when one is last is a logical consequence of the first.
	$p$ is called the *premise* and $q$ is called the *conclusion*. **Is true when both $p$ and $q$ are true and when $p$ is false**, the truth value of $q$ when $p$ it's true **doesn't matter** for the whole proposition.
