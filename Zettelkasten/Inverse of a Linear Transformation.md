Let $T:V \rightarrow W$ be a [[Bijective Linear Transformations|bijective]] [[Linear Transformations|linear transformation]], Let $\alpha = \{v_{1},v_{2}, \cdots, v_{n}\} \subset V$ be a [[Theorems and Proofs for Basis and Dimension|basis]]of the [[Domain]] $V$. then $\{Tv_{1},\cdots, Tv_{n}\}$ is a [[Span|spanning set]] of the [[Image of a linear transformation|image]] of $T$. From the theorem that [[Injective transformations preserve independence]], $\{Tv_{1},\cdots Tv_{n}\}$ is also a [[Theorems and Proofs for Basis and Dimension|basis]] of the [[Image of a linear transformation|image]].
Since $T$ is [[Surjective Functions|surjective]], $\im(T)=W$, therefore $\{Tv_{1}, \cdots, Tv_{n}\}$ is a [[Theorems and Proofs for Basis and Dimension|basis]] of the [[Range]] $W$.
Notice that $\dim(V) = \dim(W) = n$ for $T$ to be invertible.

We know we can [[Find the law of a transformation through a basis and some results]], Hence we can find $T^{-1}$.
Notation: $T: V \rightarrow W \implies T^{-1}:W \rightarrow V$.
$$\begin{align*}
T^{-1}(Tv_{1}) &= v_{1}\\
\vdots\\

\end{align*}$$
