Let $T:V \rightarrow W$ be a [[Linear Transformations|linear transformation]] over two [[Vector Space|vector spaces]] $V$ and $W$. then the *image of $T$* denoted $\im(T)$ is a [[Subsets|subset]] of $W$ and is made of all vectors in $V$ that are transformed by $T$, $\im(T) \subset W$.
Definition:
$$\begin{align*}
\im(T)
\end{align*}$$
