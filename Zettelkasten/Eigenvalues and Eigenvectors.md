A rotation $R_{\theta}$ is a [[Linear maps|linear map]] of $\mathbb{R^{3}}$ where the [[Vector|vectors]] rotate through an axis $t$ by an angle $\theta$. However, if we apply the rotation to a vector in the axis $t$, it won't direction at all. Such vectors $v$ when applied some transformation $T$ that **do not change direction** and are **only scaled by a factor $\lambda$** are called ***eigenvectors***, and the [[Scalar|scalars]] $\lambda$ are called the ***eigenvalues***. 
Eigen's are associated to a [[Linear Transformations|transformation]], each transformation has one, many or **no** eigen's at all.
