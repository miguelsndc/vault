> [!important] Def
A Integer $p$ such that $p>1$, is **prime** if and only if it's only factors are *$1$ and $p$ itself*

A Number that is not prime, is called **composite**. So $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ is composite if and only if $\exists c$ such that $c \mid n$ and $1 \lt c \lt n$. from the [[Divisibility of Integers]].
