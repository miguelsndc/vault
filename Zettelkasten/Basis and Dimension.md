Let $V$ be a [[Vector Space]], a set of vectors $S = \{v_{1},v_{2},\cdots, v_{n}\}$ is called a **basis** of $V$ [[If and Only if]] $\span(S) = V$ and $S$ is [[Linear (In)dependence.|linearly independent]]. The **dimension** of a vector space is the number of elements in the basis. if $\dim(V) = n$ and $S$ is a basis of $V$, then $|S| = n$.
