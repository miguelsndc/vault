Let $\alpha = \{u_{1}, \cdots, u_{n}\}$ and $\beta = \{v_{1},\cdots, v_{n}\}$ be two [[Theorems and Proofs for Basis and Dimension|basis]] of a [[Vector Space|space]] $V$, let $s \in V$, then $s$ can be written as a [[Linear Combinations|linear combination]] of both $\alpha$: $s = a_{1}u_{1}+\cdots+a_{n}u_{n}$ and $\beta$: $s = b_{1}v_{1}+\cdots + b_{n}v_{n}$. We say that the **coordinates** of $s$ relative to $\beta$, denoted by $[s]_{\beta} = \begin{pmatrix}a_{1}\\ \vdots \\ a_{n}\end{pmatrix}$, are the [[Scalar|scalars]] multiplying the ve
