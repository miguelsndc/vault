We can understand lines as [[Intersection]] of [[Planes]], we have seen that planes can intersect at a line at that [[Definition of a System of Linear Equations|system]] represents the line in space.
There's another way to think about it: as the **trajectory of a moving point** in space, moving at constant speed on the line. This trajectory can be expressed as a [[Functions|function]] of time, where $Q(t)$ represents where the point is at time "$t$".
Let $Q_{0}$ be the starting point, i.e, $t=0$, and $Q_{1}$ when $t=1$.
