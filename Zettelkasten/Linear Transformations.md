Let $V$ and $U$ be [[Vector Space|vector spaces]], and a "mapping" $A: E \rightarrow F$ is called *a **linear transformation*** if:
- $A(u+v) = A(u) + A(v)$
- $A(ku) = k\cdot A(u)$ 
$\forall v,u \in E, \forall k \in \mathbb{R}$.
We need both addition and [[Multiplication by Scalar|scalar multiplication]] to be preserved under transformations. The origin must also be preserved.
The "body" or the rules defined inside of a linear transformation represent a [[Homogeneous System]] where each rule is the L.H.S of a equation. $i.e$, a transformation is linear [[If and Only if]] it's L.H.S represent a homogeneous system.
