Let $f$ be [[Differentiability and Continuity|differentiable]] and [[Differentiability and Continuity|continuous]] on some [[Intervals|interval]] $I$, and let $p$ be a point in $I$. The tangent line passing on $(p, f(p))$ is $y=f(p) + f'(p)(x-p)$.
Let $T(x) = f(p) + f'(p)(x-p)$.
- $f$ is *concave up* if $f(x) > T(x)$ for any $x,p \in I$ with $x\ne p$.
- $f$ is *concave down* if $f(x) \lt T(x)$ for any $x,p \in I$ with $x \ne p$.
