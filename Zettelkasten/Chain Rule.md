Chain rule for [[Derivative Definition]] is a faster way to solve complicated derivatives, break the [[Functions in Discrete Math|function]] in two [[Composite Functions]], and inside and outside:

>[!tip] Definition of the Chain Rule
>Suppose that we have two functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ and they are both differentiable.
>
>1. We define $F(x) = (f \circ g)(x)$ then the derivative of $F(x)$ is:
>$F'(x)=f'(g(x))\cdot g'(x)$ 
>
>2. If we have $y=f(u)$ and $u=g(x)$ then the derivative of $y$ is:
>  $\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{dy}{du} \frac{du}{dx}$
