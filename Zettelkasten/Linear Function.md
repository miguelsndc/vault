A Linear Function is [[Functions|function]] that assumes the form of a [[Linear Equation]]. It means:
$$\begin{align*}
f(x) &= ax+b
\end{align*}$$
Where $a$ is the [[Average Rate of Change|slope]] and $b$ is the [[Intercepts|y-intercept]]. From the defintion both the [[Average Rate of Change]] and the slope are equal to $a$.w
