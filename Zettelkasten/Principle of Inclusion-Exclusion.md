The principle of inclusion-exclusion applies the [[Subtraction Rule]] in terms of [[Sets]] to find the [[Cardinality]] of the [[Union]] of two or more sets.

>[!tip] Definition
>To find the cardinality of the union of $n$ sets, we first sum the cardinality of each set and subtract this sum by the all possible intersections, see:
>*notice that we subtract only once, just to avoid counting twice*.

>|A\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A\cap B|
