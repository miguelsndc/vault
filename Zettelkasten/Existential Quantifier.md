The existential [[Quantifiers|quantifier]] is a way to form a proposition that is true if and only if **at least one** of $P(x)$ is true for the specified domain.
The notation $\exists x P(x)$ denotes the existential quantifier. As the [[Universal Quantifier]] is a set of **conjunctions**, the existential quantifier is a set of **disjunctions**, only of element in the domain needs to satisfy $P(x)$ for the whole thing to be true.
