Suppose $A$ is a non-square $m\times n$ [[Matrix Definition|matrix]], for a [[Matrix Multiplication|multiplication]] between $A$ and another matrix $B$ to be possible, $B$ has to match in number of rows the number of columns of $A$. So if $A$ is $m\times n$ then $B$ should be $n\times p$. Where $p$ is arbitrary.

Then the result of this multiplication will be a $m\times p$ matrix $C$.
