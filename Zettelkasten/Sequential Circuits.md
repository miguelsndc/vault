Circuit where the output not only depends on the present inputs, but also previous states/inputs. A classical example is a counter, where the next state depends on the previous, i.e, previous + 1.

A Sequential circuit is basically a combinational circuit that keeps some information stored in memory as binary, then uses both the input and the current state in memory to give the output.
