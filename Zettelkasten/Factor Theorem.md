This theorem states that $c$ is a zero of a [[Polynomials|polynomial]] $P$ if and only if $(x-c)$ is a factor of $P(x)$
See:
___
If $P(x)$ factors as $(x-c)Q(x)$, then:
$$\begin{align*}
P(c) &= (c-c)Q(x)=0\cdot Q(x)=0
\end{align*}$$
So if $P(c) = 0$ then by the [[Remainder Theorem]]:
$$\begin{align*}
P(x) &= (x-c)Q(x)+0=(x-c)Q(x)
\end{align*}$$
So $(x-c)$ is a factor of $P(x)$
