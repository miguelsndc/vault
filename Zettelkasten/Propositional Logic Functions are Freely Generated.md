Let $PROP$ be the [[Sets|set]] of valid expressions of #propositional-logic , we want to prove that $PROP$ is a [[Freely Generated Sets|freely generated set]], thus we have to show each property:

Let $X$ be the [[Theorems and Proofs for Basis and Dimension|basis]] where $X=\{0, 1, \lor, \land, \implies, \lnot\}$  and $F = \{ f_{\lor}, f_{\land}, f_{\implies}, f_{\lnot} \}$. Thus $PROP$ is the [[Inductive Sets and Closures|inductive closure]] of $X$ over $F$, so we want to
