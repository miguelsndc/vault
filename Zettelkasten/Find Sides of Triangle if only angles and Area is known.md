To find the length of the sides of a triangle if only the [[Angle|angles]] and the area are known *(or two angles, do $180 - A - B$ to find the third)*. Assume we are dealing with a non-[[Right Triangle]].

Suppose the $\triangle{ABC}$ with Area = $S$.

Notice that $S = \frac{ah}{2}$ where $h$ is a segment from $A$ to $BC$.
See that $h = c\sin{B}$ *(or $b\sin{C}$, works either way)*, so:
$$\begin{align*}
$$\frac{ac\sin{B}}{2}
\end{align*}$$
