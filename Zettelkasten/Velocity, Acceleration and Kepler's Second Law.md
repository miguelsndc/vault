**Position**: The position vector $\vec{r}(t)$ tells us the trajectory of a moving point in space with respect to time, it's the vector from the origin all the way to the point $\vec{r}(t)$.

**Velocity**: The velocity vector $\vec{v}$ tells **how fast** you're going in a certain trajectory and it also tells in which direction you're going, which is useful information if you're trying to figure out where you're going:
$$\begin{align*}
\vec{v}=\frac{d \vec{r}}{dt}\\
\end{align*}$$
The velocity [[Vector]] is the [[Derivative Definition|derivative]] of **position** with respect to **time**, it makes sense since, how fast you're changing position is in fact how fast you're moving and to which direction.

**Speed**: Is a [[Scalar]] quantity, which is just the [[Vector Norm|magnitude]] of the vector $\vec{v}$.

**Acceleration**: is the derivative of **velocity** with respect to time $\vec{a} = \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt}$. *If the speed is constant, i.e the velocity vector is constant, this does not mean the acceleration is zero, the velocity vector can still **rotate** while maintaining the same magnitude, and that rotation produces acceleration.*

## Arc Length

The distance you have traveled along the curve, integral of the speed over time yields the arc length along the trajectory of a curve. $s=$ *distance traveled along the trajectory*
