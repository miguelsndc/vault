**Velocity**: The velocity vector $\vec{v}$ tells **how fast** you're going in a certain trajectory and it also tells in which direction you're going, which is useful information if you're trying to figure out where you're going:
$$\begin{align*}
\vec{v}=\frac{d \vec{r}}{dt}\\
\end{align*}$$
The velocity [[Vector]] is the [[Derivative Definition|derivative]] of **position** with respect to **time**, it makes sense since, how fast you're changing position is in fact how fast you're moving and to which direction.

**Speed**: Is a [[Scalar]] quantity, which is just the [[Vector Norm|magnitude]] of the vector $\vec{v}$.
