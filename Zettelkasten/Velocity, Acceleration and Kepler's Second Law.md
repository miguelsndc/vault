**Velocity**: The velocity vector $\vec{v}$ tells **how fast** you're going in a certain trajectory and it also tells in which direction you're going, which is useful information if you're trying to figure out where you're going:
$$\begin{align*}
\vec{v}=\frac{d \vec{r}}{dt}\\
\end{align*}$$
The velocity [[Vector]] is the [[Derivative Definition|derivative]] of **position** with respect t
