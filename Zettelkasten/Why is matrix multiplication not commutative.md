To multiply two [[Matrix Definition|matrices]] where both **aren't** in [[Vector Matrix Form|column vector]] form nor [[Vector Matrix Form|row vector ]] form, we need to apply the [[Scalar Product|dot product]] between the rows of the one on **the left** and the **columns** of the one on the right.

Looks like:

- The number of **columns of the 1st matrix** must equal the number of **rows of the 2nd matrix**.
- And the result will have the same number of **rows as the 1st matrix**, and the same number of **columns as the 2nd matrix**.
