Frequently we want order to matter when working with discrete structures, tuples allow us to organize elements in a manner that order matters, See:
$T = (a, b, c)$, The tuple $T$ is a tuple that contains elements $a$, $b$ and $c$ in this exact order, if somehow another tuple shows up with the exact same elements **shuffled**, it's a completely different tuple. Tuples are useful specifically to define [[Cartesian Product]], since we want every pair to be different based on order.
