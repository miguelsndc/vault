With $Ax=b$ [[Definition of a System of Linear Equations|system]], by trying to read off the solutions we come across some cases, consider the homogeneous case: $Ax=0$ for the following [[Definition of a System of Linear Equations|system]]:
$$\begin{align*}
Ux&=
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 3 & 3 & 2\\
0 & 0 & 3 & 1\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
u\\ v \\ w \\ y
\end{pmatrix}
&= 
\begin{pmatrix}
0\\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}$$
Here the unknowns fall into two categories, **basic variables**: *(columns with non-zero [[Pivot|pivots]])*, first and third columns in this case, so $u$ and $w$ are our basic variables.
The other category is made of **free variables**, *(columns with zero [[Pivot|pivots]])*, second and fourth columns, so $v$ and $y$ are our free variables.
To find a general solution for this we may assign arbitrary values, the so called **parameters**, to $v$ and $y$, our **free variables**, See:
$$\begin{align*}
u+3v+3w+2y &= 0\\
3w + y &= 0\\
\text{It follows:}\\
w &= -\frac{1}{3}y\\
u&= -3-y
\end{align*}$$
There is a "double infinity" of solutions with two free and independent parameters $v$ and $y$. The general solution is the [[Linear Combination]]:
$$\begin{align*}
x&= \begin{pmatrix}
-3v-y\\
v\\
-\frac{1}{3}y\\
y
\end{pmatrix}&=
v 
\begin{pmatrix}
-3\\1\\0\\0\\
\end{pmatrix}
+y
\begin{pmatrix}
-1\\0\\- \frac{1}{3}\\1\\
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}$$
The $v$ column $(-3, 1, 0, 0)$  is the solution when $v=1$ and $y=0$, and the [[Vector|vector]] $(-1, 0,- \frac{1}{3}, 1)$ is the solution when $v=0$ and $y=1$. All solutions are linear combinations of these two.
Here we are dealing with the **Null Vectors** of $Ax=0$, their solutions. The vectors no longer have the same length as the columns of $A$, they have, not $m$ but $n$ components, matching $A$ rows.
In a geometric point of view, within four-dimensional space of all possible $x$, the solutions for $Ax=0$ form a [[Linear Subspaces|subspace]] of $A$, the [[Nullspace]] of $A$, A two dimensional plane generated by all possible linear combinations of $(-3,1,0,0)$ and $(-1,0,- \frac{1}{3},1)$. Despite all this talking, parameterization consists of the previous step of assigning values to $v$ and $y$. and creating a general solution based off linear combinations of these parameters.
