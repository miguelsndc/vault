Events are [[Subsets]] of the [[Sample Space]] of some phenomena, they represent one or more possible outcomes. They're represented by capital letters $A,B, \cdots$, the [[Empty Set|empty set]], as usual, is represented by $\emptyset$.
The [[Union]] of two *events* $A$ and $B$ represent occurrence of either $A$, $B$, or both.
The [[Intersection]] of two events $A$ and $B$ represent the simultaneous occurrence of $A$ and $B$.
Two events are [[Disjoint Set|disjoint]] or **mutually exclusive** if their intersection is the empty set $\emptyset$. And two events are complementary if their intersection is empty and their union is the whole sample space $\Omega$.
