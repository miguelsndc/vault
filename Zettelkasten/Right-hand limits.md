Right hand [[Intuitive Definition of Limits|limits]], means that for a limit $f(x) \to A$ as $x \to p$ through values **greather than $p$**, we say that $A$ is the right hand limit of $f$ at $p$, indicated by:
$$\begin{align*}
\lim_{x\to p^{+}}f(x)=A
\end{align*}$$
by the [[Epsilon-Delta Definition of a Limit]] this means that for every $|f(x) - A| < \epsilon$ there is some $0 \lt |x-p| \lt \delta$ such that $x \gt p$.
