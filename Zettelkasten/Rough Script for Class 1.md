# Visualization Ideas for Linear Transformations Unit

## Aula 1: Linear Transformations Concepts and Properties
### Key Visualizations:
- Basic 2D coordinate grid with clearly marked axes
- Simple transformations demonstrations:
  - Scaling: Show grid stretching/compressing uniformly and non-uniformly
  - Rotation: Smooth animation of entire grid rotating around origin
  - Shear: Emphasize parallel lines remaining parallel during transformation
- Properties visualization:
  - Grid line preservation under transformation
  - Origin fixed point demonstration
  - Vector addition and scalar multiplication preservation

## Aula 2: Kernel and Image as Subspaces
### Key Visualizations:
- Kernel demonstration:
  - Highlight vectors that map to zero vector
  - Special case: 2D to 1D transformation showing kernel as a line
  - Animation of vectors in kernel collapsing to origin
- Image visualization:
  - Show "reachable" vectors after transformation
  - Highlight complete image space
  - Demonstrate how image is spanned by transformed basis vectors
- Dimension relationship:
  - Visual proof of dim(ker) + dim(im) = dim(domain)
  - Interactive transformation showing vectors getting mapped

## Aula 3: Injective, Surjective, and Bijective Transformations
### Key Visualizations:
- Injective (one-to-one):
  - Show distinct vectors mapping to distinct outputs
  - Counter-example: projection transformation
  - Emphasize no "overlapping" in output
- Surjective (onto):
  - Demonstrate every vector in codomain being "reached"
  - Counter-example: embedding into higher dimension
  - Show complete coverage of codomain
- Bijective:
  - Combine previous visualizations
  - Show perfect one-to-one correspondence
  - Demonstrate invertibility

## Aula 4: Composition and Inverse of Linear Transformations
### Key Visualizations:
- Composition:
  - Step-by-step application of two transformations
  - Compare AB vs BA to show non-commutativity
  - Track individual vectors through multiple transformations
- Inverse transformations:
  - Show transformation being "undone"
  - Demonstrate why some transformations aren't invertible
  - Visualize relationship between matrix invertibility and transformation invertibility

## Aula 5: Kernel and Image Theorem
### Key Visualizations:
- Fundamental theorem:
  - Visual representation of dimension relationship
  - Show kernel "collapsing" process
  - Demonstrate image building process
- Dimensional analysis:
  - Show relationship between input and output spaces
  - Visualize rank and nullity
  - Demonstrate dimension preservation/reduction

## Aula 6: Transformation Matrix
### Key Visualizations:
- Matrix construction:
  - Show basis vectors transforming
  - Build transformation matrix column by column
  - Demonstrate relationship between geometry and matrix entries
- Matrix multiplication:
  - Visual connection between matrix multiplication and transformation
  - Show how matrix entries affect transformation
  - Demonstrate basis transformation process

## Additional Notes:
- Consider using consistent color coding throughout animations
- Include interactive elements where possible
- Maintain clear labeling of axes and vectors
- Use smooth transitions between states
- Include pause points for discussion
- Consider adding grid lines or reference points for clarity
- Use appropriate speed for student comprehension

## Implementation Considerations:
- Start with simple 2D examples before moving to 3D
- Use consistent notation throughout
- Include before/after states for each transformation
- Consider adding unit circles or unit squares for reference
- Use animation timing to emphasize important concepts
- Include vector field visualizations where appropriate
