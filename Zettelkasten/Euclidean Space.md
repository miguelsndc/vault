Consider three [[Linear (In)dependence.|linearly independent]] [[Orthogonal Vectors|orthogonal]] vectors of length $1$ that cross at a point $O$ called the **origin**. These vectors are called a [[Orthonormal Basis]] of that space, there is a special set of those vectors, considered the simplest possible basis, the ***canonical basis of $R^{3}$***,  denoted by $\epsilon = \{(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1)\}$, they [[Span]] a space called the *Euclidean Three Dimensional Space*.
