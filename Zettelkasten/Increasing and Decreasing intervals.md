The growth of [[Functions]] can be described by the [[Derivative Definition|derivatives]], Let $f$ be [[Differentiability and Continuity|differentiable]] on a interval $(a,b)$.
- $f$ is  ***strictly** increasing* if $s \lt t \implies f(s) \lt f(t)$ 
- $f$ is *decreasing* if $s < t \implies f(s) \gt f(t)$, $\forall s \forall t \in (a,b)$.

As a consequence of the [[Mean Value Theorem]]: Let $f$ [[Differentiability and Continuity|continuous]] on some [[Intervals|interval]] $I$
- If $f'(x) \gt 0 \forall x \in I$
