A plane is a flat-surface in $3$-dimensional space, [[Span|span]]ned by two [[Vector|vectors]]. It is defined either parametrically with three points contained in the plane: $P_{0}, P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$, where we take the vectors $\vec{P_{0}P_{1}}$ and $\vec{P_{0}P_{2}}$, for example, and define the plane as all [[Linear Combinations|linear combination]]s of these two.
Or we can take a simpler approach, and define the plane as all vectors $P= \innp{x,y,z}$ such that the [[Dot Product|dot product]] between $P$ and a **normal** vector $\hat{n}$ is $0$, this means all vectors that are perpendicular to $\hat{n}$, thus forming a plane. if $\hat{n} = \innp{a,b,c}$ then the [[Equation]] of the plane is$ax+by+cz+d=0$. $d$ is a constant term that allows this definition to represent planes that don't pass through the origin.
