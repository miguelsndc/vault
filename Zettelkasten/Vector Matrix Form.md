A [[Vector|vector]] can be expressed in [[Matrix Definition|matrix]] notation, instead of writing as [[Coordinate|coordinate]], so we can perform operations with matrices, a vector that in coordinate form was $(x,y,z)$ can be written in **column form** as $\begin{bmatrix}x \\ y \\ z\end{bmatrix}$. or in **row form** as: $\begin{bmatrix}x&y&z\end{bmatrix}$.
