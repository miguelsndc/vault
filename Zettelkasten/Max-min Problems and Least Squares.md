## Optimization Problems (Maximization / Minimization) of functions of several variables

Let's figure out how to use [[Level Curves, Partial Derivatives and Tangent Plane|partial derivative]]s to handle optimization problems, partial derivatives monitor changes of a multivariable function choosing one to differentiate with respect to, while treating the others as constant. $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}=f_{x}$ 

**Approximation Formula**

The linear approximation formula for single variable functions around a certain point, works by finding the $1$st order taylor polynomal near that point, that is, **we match** the first deriva
