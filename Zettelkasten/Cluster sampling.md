Cluster sampling consists of dividing the [[Population|population]] into [[Random sample|random]] subgroups called "clusters", then [[Sample|sample]] the clusters, not taking a sample from inside the cluster, but [[Sample|sample]] the clusters using another technique.
This is usually used when dealing with large amounts of data and/or data that is geographically sparse, then using schools or cities as a clusters.
