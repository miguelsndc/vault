In some [[Relations]], an element is related to a second element [[If and Only if|if and only if]] the second is related to the first, those relations are called *symmetric*,

Let $A = \{1,2,3\}]$ and $R = \{(1,2), (2,1), (3,3), (2,2)\}$, $R$ is **symmetric**, because $(1,2) \in R$ and $(2,1)$ is also in $R$, same for $(3,3)$ and $(4,4)$. However $R$ is **not** [[Reflexive Relations|reflexive]], since $(1,1) \notin R$.
