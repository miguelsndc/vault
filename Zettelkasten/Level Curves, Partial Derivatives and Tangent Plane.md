## How to visualize functions of several variables ? 

Plotting functions of three of more variables is impossible, so we stick to functions of two variables, $f(x,y)=z$. There exists some options to visualize them:
1. Plot the graph with $x,y$ and $z$ axis, but the difficulty of drawing such functions grows immensely depending on the complexity of the given function.
2. **Countor plot**:
A Countour plot of a given function $f$ shows all the points where $f(x,y)=c$ for some constant $c$, $i.e$ $f(x,y)=1$ $f(x,y)=2$ and so on, it works by intersecting a plane $z=c$ on the function and plotting the intersection points outlining the level on the final plot, it works like a **map**, telling you **how high** things are, the **elevation being the value of $z$**:

> Those points that are outlined when intersected by horizontal planes are called **level curves** of $f$ at a certain level $c$.

It is very easy to find values of $f$, given an input $(x,y)$, depending on the location of the input we can easily see that it is between $1$ and $2$ or $3$ and $2$ and so on.
