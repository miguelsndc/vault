## How to visualize functions of several variables ? 

Plotting functions of three of more variables is impossible, so we stick to functions of two variables, $f(x,y)=z$. There exists some options to visualize them:
1. Plot the graph with $x,y$ and $z$ axis, but the difficulty of drawing such functions grows immensely depending on the complexity of the given function.
2. **Countor plot**:
A Countour plot of a given function $f$ shows all the points where $f(x,y)=c$ for some constant $c$, $i.e$ $f(x,y)=1$ $f(x,y)=2$ and so on:
