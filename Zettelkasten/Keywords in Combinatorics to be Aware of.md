Combinatorics is tricky as fuck but there's some keywords that indicate, or kinda guide where we need to go, see:
- **"Or"**: indicates [[Disjoint Set|disjoint]] sets, it means we should use [[Sum Rule]] somewhere.
- "**And**" indicates [[Joint Sets]], we need [[Product Rule]]
- "**At Least**" or "**Not**"": indicates [[The Complement Rule]].
- For the [[Subtraction Rule]]: "**both**"; Speacially when we are dealing with multiple [[Sets]] and need to find some kind of "common value" between two or more.
