The *transpose* of a [[Matrix Definition|matrix]] $A$ is obtained when the rows become the columns, and the columns become the rows. denoted $A^{T}$. $e.g.$
$$\begin{align*}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 3 & 2\\
2& 1 & 5\\
1 & 2 & 3
\end{pmatrix}^{T}=
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 1\\
3 & 1 & 2\\
2 & 5 & 3
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}$$
The $i$th row of $A$ becomes the $i$th column of $A^{T}$. Tranposition can also be seen as "fliping $A$ over the diagonal", and it follows a set of [[Properties of Transposition of Matrices]].
