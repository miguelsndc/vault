Let $f$ be a [[Functions in Discrete Math|function]] from $A$ to $B$ $f: A \rightarrow B$. $f$ is a **partial function** if it isn't a **total function**. A Total function is a normal function, where every element in domain is assigned to some element in the range.

So it follows that a partial function is a function where not every $a \in A$ is assigned to some $b \in B$, they just don't have a mapping.

For example, Let $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \implies f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$.
The domain of $f$ is all [[Real Numbers]] except for $0$, since $f(0)=\frac{1}{0}$ is not defined, so there is a element unmapped in the domain, therefore $f$ is a partial function.
