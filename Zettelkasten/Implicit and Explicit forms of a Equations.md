A Equation is in it's *implicit* form if, while having $y$ as a [[Functions in Discrete Math|function]] of $x$, $x$'s and $y$'s are mixed in the equation, there is no **explicit** definition $y = \cdots$, So:

>[!tip] Definition
>A Equation is in *implicit form* if it's variables are mixed in both sides and we don't have a clear sight of which is in function of which, like: $x^{3}+y^{3}= xy+ 5$

>A Equation is in *explicit* form if we can clearly see which variables are in function of which, like: $y = \cdots$ or $z = \cdots$.
