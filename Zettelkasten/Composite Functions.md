The composition of any given two [[Functions]] $f$ and $g$ is denoted by: $(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x))$, we take the output of $g$ and plug-in to $f$ this is not limited to just two functions.
The **[[Domain|domain]]** of $f\circ g$ is the [[Sets|set]] of all $x$ in the domain of $g$ where $g(x)$ is in the domain of $f$.
