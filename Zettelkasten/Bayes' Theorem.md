First, let's define a **partition** of a [[Sample Space]]. The [[Event|events]] $C_{1},C_{2}, \cdots, C_{k}$ form a partition of $\Omega$, if, they **don't intersect** and **their union is the sample space**, that means:
$$\begin{align*}
C_{i} \cap C_{j}&= \emptyset\;,i\ne j;\\
\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{k}C_{i}&= \Omega,
\end{align*}$$
So, the [[Probability|probability]] $P$ of some event $A$, is equal to the sum of the intersections of $A$ with each of the members of the partition: $P(A) = P(A\cap C_{1}) + P(A \cap C_{2}) + \cdots + P(A \cap C_{k})$.

Suppose the events $C_{1},C_{2}, \cdots, C_{k}$ form a partition of $\Om$
