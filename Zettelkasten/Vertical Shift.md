Adding a constant $c$ to a [[Functions|function]] shifts it's [[Graph of a Function|graph]] $c$ units upwards or downwards, let's suppose $y=f(x)$, if we add $c$ we have $y=f(x) + c$, we are effectively modifying the output of the function, or the $y$-value.

Suppose $c\gt0$:
- To graph $y=f(x)+c$, shift the graph upwards $c$ units.
- To graph $y=f(x)-c$, shift the graph downwards $c$ units.
