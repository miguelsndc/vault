Consider $T:V \rightarrow W$ [[Linear Transformations|linear transformation]] and two [[Theorems and Proofs for Basis and Dimension|basis]] $\alpha=\{v_{1},\cdots, v_{n}\}, \beta = \{w_{1},\cdots, w_{n}\}$ where $\dim{V} = n$ and $\dim{W} = m$,
Let $v \in V$, so $v$ can be written as $v= a_{1}v_{1} + \cdots + a$
