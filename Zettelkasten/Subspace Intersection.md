Consider $V$ a [[Vector Space]] and $S_{1},S_{2} \subset V$ where $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ are [[Linear Subspaces|subspaces]], then, $S_{1} \cap S_{2}$ is also a subspace. Consider the definition:
$$\begin{align*}
S_{1}\cap S_{2}=\{v\in V \mid v \in S_{1}\text{ and } v \in S_{2}\}
\end{align*}$$
Proof:
1. Since $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ are both subspaces of $V$ they both contain $\vec{0}$, so $\vec{0} \in S_{1}\cap S_{2}$.
2. Let $u,v \in S_{1}\cap S_{2}$, then, in particular $u,v \in S_1$, since $S_1$ is a subspace so $u+v \in S_{1}$, same holds for $S_{2}$. so $u+v \in S_{1}\cap S_{2}$.
3. Let $a$ be a [[Scalar]], so if $u \in S_1$ then $au\in S_1$, same holds for $S_{2}$, so $au \in S_{1}\cap S_{2}$.
