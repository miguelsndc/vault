>In here we consider vectors as *three-dimensional* but things also apply for 2D vectors.

Vectors are mathematical quantities that have both a **direction** and a [[Vector Norm|magnitude]]. A vector $\vec{a}$ can be decomposed into the [[Vector Normalization|unitary vector]]s $\vec{i}$, $\vec{j}$, $\vec{k}$, the unitary vectors pointing in the directions of the coordinate axis in [[Vector Space|space]].
$$\begin{align*}
\vec{a} &= a_{1}\vec{i}+ a_{2}\vec{j} + a_{3}\vec{k}
\end{align*}$$
Where $a_{1},a_{2}$ and $a_3$ are **[[Scalar|scalar]]** quantities *(fancy name for numerical quantities as opposed to vector quantities)*. A can also be written as $\vec{a} = \innp{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3}}$. 

If two points $P$ and $Q$ exist in space we can extract a vector from $P$ to $Q$ or vice-versa. by subtracting the coordinates of the endpoint minus the origin point: $\vec{PQ} = Q- P$. This works because we can think of both $P$ and $Q$ as vectors from the origin to the respective "tips" $P$ and $Q$, and the subtraction of two vectors give the difference in trajectory from the first to the second in the subtraction.
