In [[Divisibility of Integers]], if $a \mid b$ and $b \mid c$, this means that $a \mid c$, such [[Relations]] are called *transitive* relations.

> [!tip] Transitivity
> A relation $R$ on a set $A$ is called *transitive* if whenever $(a,b) \in R$ and $(b,c) \in R$, then $(a,c) \in R$, for all $a,b,c \in A$.

[[Subsets]], [[Divisibility of Integers]], [[Inequality]], are all examples of transitive relations, see:
$$\begin{align*}
A \subset B \land B \subset C &\implies A \subset C\\
a \mid b \land b \mid c &\implies a \mid c\\
a \lt b \land b \lt c &\implies a\lt c
\end{align*}$$.
