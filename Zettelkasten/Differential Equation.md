A Differential [[Equation]] is a *equation* that relates one or more **unknown** [[Functions|function]]s and their [[Derivative Definition|derivatives]]. Generally, the functions represent physical quantities, their derivatives the rates of change, and the equation, some relationship between them. Therefore being wildly used in engineering and other fields.

Examples are: $$\begin{align*}
\frac{dx}{dt}=x^{2}+t
\end{align*}$$
Where $x = x(t)$ is a function, and $t$ is an independent variable, a differential equation can have **orders**, that means, involving $n$-degree derivatives.
