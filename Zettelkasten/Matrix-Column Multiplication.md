Let $A$ be a $m\times n$ [[Matrix Definition|matrix]] and $x$ be a $n \times 1$ [[Vector Matrix Form|column vector]], we shall obtain the product $Ax = b$.
 
There's two ways to approach this multiplication, one that goes through every component of every row of $A$ and another that provides a combinations of the columns of $A$, we shall discuss each one separately:
# First Approach
