![[triangle]]
The area of the above triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\norm{b}\norm{a}\sin{\theta}$ (*half base * height*), but we don't know sines! But we're pretty good at cosines, using [[Dot Product]]'s, we could solve for $\sin{\theta}$ then substitute into $\sin^{2}{\theta} + \cos^{2}{\theta} = 1$, but that's a lot of work. instead we can use determinants:
