Implicit differentation is a technique used to find [[Derivatives]] of [[Implicit and Explicit forms of a Equations|implicit]] equations, *notice we must assume $y$ is a [[Functions in Discrete Math|function]] of $x$*.
Hence we can find tangent lines and solve derivative problems in implicitly defined curves that **aren't functions**. To achieve so, we **derive** both sides of this equation in respect to $x$, and everywhere we derive a $y$ we add a $\frac{dy}{dx}$ or $y'$. See:

$$\begin{align*}
x^{2}+y^{2}&= 100\\
\frac{d}{dx}[x^2+y^{2}&= \frac{d}{dx}[100]\\
2x+2y \frac{dy}{dx}&= 0\\
\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{-x}{y}
\end{align*}$$
