Is a type of statistical error that occur when an analyst chooses a [[Sample|sample]] that does not entirely represent the [[Population|population]] of data. As a result, the results found in the sample do not represent the results obtained from the entire population. Non-sampling errors are those that are not sampling errors, that might occur during analysis.
