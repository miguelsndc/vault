A [[Definition of a System of Linear Equations|system of linear equations]] having a [[Matrix Definition|matrix]] form of $Ax=\vec{0}$, where $\vec{0}$ represent a **zero [[Column Matrix]]** is called a **Homogeneous System**.
The solution set for a homogeneous system is always a vector [[Linear Subspaces|subspace]], hence they are one of the primary ways to represent vector subspaces. 
Consider the system:
$$\begin{align*}
S &= \Bigg\{(x,y,z)\in \mathbb{R}^{3}\mid
\theta\begin{cases}
x+2y+z=0\\
2x-2y+z=0\\
\end{cases} 
  \Bigg\}
\end{align*}$$
$S$ is a subspace described by the system $\theta$.
