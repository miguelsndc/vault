[[A = LU Factorization]] regarding the [[Non-Singular Case Matrix of a System]], is different, since non-singular matrices require row [[Row Exchanges|exchanges]], with row exchanges we cannot *form a [[Lower Triangular Matrix]] with non-zero diagonals*, so **LU** is done, notice that $U$ is fine.
However, by perfoming the row exchanges all at once in matrix $PA$ where $P$ is the product of all the [[Permutation Matrix|permutation matrices]], with $PA$ we can find a $LU$ or [[LDU Factorization]].
