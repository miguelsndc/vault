The scalar triple product is a operation between three vectors that figures out the volume of a parallelepiped formed by the three [[Vector|vectors]].
It's denoted by the [[Scalar Product|Scalar Product]] of a vector $w$ with the [[Cross Product]] of two other vectors $u$ and $v$.
$$\begin{align*}
w\cdot(u\times v)
\end{align*}$$
This is pretty much a $3\times3$ determinant, so you can forget about the [[Canonical Vectors]] and solve it to get a number which is the volume of the parallelepiped.
