The product rule applies when we have a procedure than can be separated into multiple tasks.

>[!Definition]
>Suppose that a procedure can be broken down into two steps, if there's $n_{1}$ ways to the first task and for each of these ways of doing the first task, there are $n_{2}$ ways of doing the second task, then there are $n_{1}n_{2}$ ways to do the procedure.

> *How many different bit strings of length seven are there ?*
