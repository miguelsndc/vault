Let $f$ be a [[Functions in Discrete Math|function]] and $p \in D_{f}$ with $f$ [[Differentiability and Continuity|continuous]] at $p$. $p$ is a **inflexion point**, if there's [[Real Numbers]] $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$, with $p \in (a,b) \subset D_{f}$. Such that $f$ has opposite [[Concavity|concavities]] at $(a,p)$ and $(p,b)$.
