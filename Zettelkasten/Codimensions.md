Codimension is a basic geometric idea that applies to [[Linear Subspaces]] in [[Vector Space|vector spaces]].

> Codimension is a relative concept; It only applies to objects *inside* other objects, there is no codimensional for two isolated objects

## Definition
Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional [[Vector Space]] over a [[Field|field]] $\mathbb{K}$. If $W$ is a linear [[Linear Subspaces|linear subspace]] of $V$. Then the codimension of $W$ in $V$ is the difference between the dimensions.
$$\begin{align*}
\rm{codim(W)}=\dim(V)-\dim(W)
\end{align*}$$
