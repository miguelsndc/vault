If $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, we say that $a$ and $b$ are **congruent** modulo $n$ if $a \bmod n = b \bmod n$, in other words, if $a$ and $b$ have the same remainder when divided by $n$, so the notation is:
$$\begin{align*}
a \equiv b \pmod n \iff a \bmod n =b \bmod n
\end{align*}$$
Another useful result is also that $a \equiv b \; (\bmod n) \iff n \mid (a-b)$.
