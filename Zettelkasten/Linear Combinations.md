A Linear combination of [[Vector|vectors]] in $n$-dimensional space is the sum of these vectors weighted by [[Multiplication by Scalar|scalar multiplication]] by some [[Real Numbers|real]] (or not) [[Scalar|scalars]].
Given a set of $k$ vectors $v_{1}, v_{2}, \cdots, v_{k}$, and $\gamma_{i}\in \mathbb{R}, i=1, 2, \cdots, k$  their linear combinations is the vector resultant of the sum $\gamma_{1}v_{1}+\gamma_{2}v_{2}+\cdots+ \gamma_{k}v_{k}=u$. A Linear combination can be expressed in terms of [[Matrix Multiplication]], Suppose $v_{k}$ has $m$ components, then if we set each column of a matrix $A$ to be a vector $v_{k}$, $A$ will be a $m$ by $k$ matrix of column-vectors, by multiplying $A$ by the **vector of weigbt**
