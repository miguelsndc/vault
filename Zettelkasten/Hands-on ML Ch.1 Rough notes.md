"Machine Learning" is the field of study that give computers that ability to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. A program "learns" with experience $E$ with respect to some task $T$, and a performance measure $P$, if it's performance on $T$, as measured by $P$, improves with experience $E$.

The data that the system uses to learn are called the **training set**. Each training example is called a *training instance*, or *sample*.

Machine learning can be used in problems that are either too complex to be solved by hand or do not have any known algorithm, for example, *speech recognition*, one might write a code that knows a couple of words, however, to recognize hundreds of languages spoken by millions of people in noisy environments and in different accents, this quickly becomes an impossible problem. The best approach is to write a machine learning system that learns by itself given **a lot** of voice examples.

Applying machine learning to dig into large amounts of data can help discover patterns that have not yet been discovered, this is called **data mining**.

Machine learning is great for:
- Problems for which solutions require too much hand-tuning or long lists of rules
- Problems that are either too complex or don't have a good solution at all using a traditional approach; *a machine learning algorithm can find a decent solution*.
- Fluctuating environments, machine learning systems adapt to new data
- Getting insights about complex problems and large amounts of data.
