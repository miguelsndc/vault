Just like division with regular numbers, such as $\frac{38}{7}= 5 + \frac{3}{7}$, Where $38$ is the **dividend**, $7$ is the **divisor**, $5$ is the **quotient** and $\frac{3}{7}$ is the **remainder**. With polynomials we follow 

If $P(x)$ and $D(x)$ are [[Polynomials]],  with $D(x) \ne 0$, then there exist unique polynomials $Q(x)$ and $R(x)$, where $R(x)$ is either $0$ or of degree less than the degree of $D(x)$. such that:
$$\begin{align*}
\frac{P(x)}{D(x)} &= Q(x)+ \frac{R(x)}{D(x)}\\
\text{or}\\
P(x) &= Q(x) \cdot D(x) + R(x)
\end{align*}$$
The polynomials $P(x)$ and $D(x)$ are called the **dividend and divisor** respectively, $Q(x)$ and $R(x)$ are called the **quotient and remainder**.
