The **least common multiple** of positive integers $a$ and $b$ is the *smallest positive integer* divisible by both $a$ and $b$, denoted $\rm{lcm}(a,b)$.
Similar to the [[Greatest Common Divisor]], instead of getting the smallest exponent in the prime factorization, we get the largest, like:
$$\begin{align*}
\rm{lcm}(a,b) &=  p_1^{\max(a_{1},b_{1})} \cdot p_2^{\max(a_{2},b_{2})} \cdot p_n^{\max(a_{n},b_{n})}
\end{align*}$$
