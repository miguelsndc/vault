A [[Functions|function]] is a [[One-to-One Functions|one-to-one function]] if and only if no horizontal line intersects it's [[Graph of a Function|graph]] more than once. 
If a horizontal line indeed crosses the function more than once, it means that for we have $f(x_{1}) = f(x_{2})$ for $x_{1}\ne x_{2}$, breaking the rules of the one-to-one functions.
