We use the following properties to solve a [[Inequality|Inequalities]] involving [[Absolute Value|Absolute values]]. *($\iff$ means "is equivalent to"* 

1. $\mid x \mid \; \lt C \iff -C \lt x \lt C$
	The distance of $-C$ and $C$ from zero in the real line is $x$
2. $\mid x \mid \; \le C \iff -C \le x \le C$
	The distance of $-C$ and $C$ from zero in the real line is $x$ including $-C$ and $C$.
3. $\mid x \mid \; > C \iff x \lt -C$ or $C \lt X$ *(Solve both)*
	$x$ comprehends the set of all numbers that are $C$ units away from 0 up to positive infinity and negative infinity. 
4. $\mid x \mid\; \ge C \iff x \le -C$ or $C \le X$ *(Solve both)*
	$x$ comprehends the set of all numbers that are $C$ units away from 0, including C, up to positive infinity and negative infinity.
