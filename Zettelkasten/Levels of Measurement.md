There are four levels of measurement: **nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio**.
- Nominal
Represent [[Categorical - Qualitative Data|categorical]] variables with no inherent order. Nominal divides variables into mutually exclusive categories according to labels, they don't have any hierarchy nor do they convey any numerical value.
- Ordinal
The ordinal scale also classifies variables into categories, which have a natural order or rank, they're still [[Categorical - Qualitative Data|qualitative]] labels though.
- Interval
Interval data is measured along a numerical scale with evenly-spaced [[Intervals]] between adjacent values. An example is temperature, where the difference between $10$ and $20$ degrees is the same as $50$ and $60$. **The differences are meaningful**.
- Ratio
Ratio data is measured along a numerical scale that has evenly-spaced intervals between adjacent values, and it has a **true zero**. An example is **weight**, you can definetely say something weights $0$ kilograms, literally nothing, but with temperature $0$ degrees doesn't mean nothing, just means it's *really cold!*.
