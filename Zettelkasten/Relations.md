Let $A$ and $B$ be [[Sets|sets]], A *binary relation* from $A$ to $B$ is a [[Subsets|subset]] of $A\times B$ ([[Cartesian Product]] of $A$ and $B$), In other words, a binary relation from $A$ to $B$ is a set $R$ of ordered pairs where the first element comes $A$ and the second comes from $B$.
We denote $a \,R\, b$ to denote $(a,b) \in R$ and $a \,/R\, b$ to denote $(a,b) \notin R$.

A [[Functions in Discrete Math|function]] from a set $A$ to $B$ assigns exactly one element of $B$ to each element of $A$. The graph of $f$ is the set of ordered pairs $(a,b)$ such that $b=f(a)$. Because the graph is a subset of $A \times B$, the graph of a function is a relation from $A$ to $B$.
A Relation can be used to express one to many relationships betweens sets, where an element of $A$ may be related to more than one element on $B$.
*A function represents a relation where exactly one element of $B$ is related to each element of $A$.* 

if $A = B$, then it's called **a relation on a set $A$**, and it's a subset of $A \times A$.
