The Projective space $\P^{2}$ is an extension of the regular cartesian $\R^{2}$ with a few additions to encompass the behaviour of cameras and express them mathematically.

![[projectivespace.excalidraw]]

We'll use the $\R^{3}$ three-dimensional space as a **host** to keep articulate both spaces and visualize their relationship. The Plane $z=1$ represents $\R^{2}$ and is called the **Projective Plane** in projective space.

### Definitions

-  
- In this new space, **points** are represented as **lines** in 3D space a point $P$ is represented with square brackets $P=[-1,2]$, but in fact, any point in the line passing through $P$ when intersecting $z=1$ is a possible **representative** for $P$, they are equivalent.
- Lines in this new space are represented by **planes**, since planes that pass through the origin will intersect $z=1$ through a line.
