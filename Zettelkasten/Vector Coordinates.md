let $V$ be a [[Vector Space|vector space]] and let $\alpha = \{w_{1},\cdots, w_{n}\}$ be a [[Theorems and Proofs for Basis and Dimension|basis]] for $V$. let $v \in V$, then $v$ can be written as a [[Linear Combinations|linear combination]] of the [[Vector|vectors]] in $\alpha$:
$$\begin{align*}
v &= a_{1}w_{1}+ a_{2}w_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}w_{n}
\end{align*}$$
The weights $a_{1},a_{2}, \cdots, a_{n}$ multiplying the vectors are called the *coordinates* of $v$, they specify how much a vector from $\alpha$ must be scaled and. The coordinates may differ from basis to basis but the vector is always the same. Coordinates are written as a [[Column Matrix]]:
$$\begin{align*}
[v]_{\alpha}=\begin{pmatrix}a_{1} \\ a_{2}\\ \vdots \\ a_{n}\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}$$
