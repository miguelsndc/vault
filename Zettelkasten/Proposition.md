A Proposition is a declarative sentence that is either **true** or **false**
- *Milk is White*
- *Humans are just fish with legs*
We cannot express: **Questions, imperatives**.
Many new propositions can be formed by combining propositions with [[Basic Logical Operators|logical operators]]. These are called **compound propositions**.
