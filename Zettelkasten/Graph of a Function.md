If $f$ is a function with [[Domain]] $A$, then the graph of $f$ is the set of ordered pairs:
$$\begin{align*}
\{(x, f(x)) \mid x \in A\}
\end{align*}$$
plotted in a [[Coordinate Plane]]. *i.e*, The graph of $f$ is the set of all points $(x,y)$ such that $y = f(x)$; that is, the graph of $f$ is the graph of the equation $y = f(x)$
