### 1.5 Exercises

$1)$ Let $P$ and $Q$ be two convex sets, also let $R = P \cap Q$, let $p$ and $q$ be two points in $R$, and $\overline{pq}$ be the segment between them. Assume by contradiction that $R$ is not convex, so there is some point $x$ along $\overline{pq}$ that is not contained in either $P$ or $Q$.

But since $p,q \in P$ and $\overline{pq} \subset P$ and $P$ is convex, so $x \in P$. same reasoning applies for $Q$, therefore the segment must be contained in both and $R$ is therefore convex.
