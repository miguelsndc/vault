### 1.5 Exercises

$1)$ Let $P$ and $Q$ be two convex sets, also let $R = P \cap Q$, let $p$ and $q$ be two points in $R$, and $\overline{pq}$ be the segment between them. Assume by contradiction that $R$ is not convex, so there is some point $x$ along $\overline{pq}$ that is not contained in $R$, so $x \notin R \implies$ $x\notin P$ or $x \notin Q$

But since $p, q \in P$ and $P$ is convex, all points along the segment $\overline{pq}$ are contained in $P$, so $x \in P$
And also $p, q \in Q$ and $Q$ is convex, all points along the segment $\overline{pq}$ are contained in $Q$ and $x \in Q$

so $x \in P \cap Q$, contradicting our assumption, therefore $R$ must be convex.

$2)$ The perimeter of a polygon is defined as the sum of lengths of the edges between two consecutive vertices, we aim to show that the smallest perimeter polygon enclosing a set of points is convex. First we need to:

1. Figure out the smallest perimeter polygon enclosing a set of points is and what makes it the "smallest".

2. Given the smallest perimiter polygon, show it is convex.

so i found out by drawing that if i make a "shell" around the points, notice that if i have three points making a triangle, it is always better to connect the two upmost points rather than connecting with the inner one, we can find that out via hypot formula, we expand and get that $a + b > c$ so we should take c, this guarantees we do not take any "left turns"on the shell, leaving spikes that create concave polygons.

i have no clue how to prove it this was the most promising idea i've had

so given $S$ as a simple polygon enclosing a set of points $P$, assume by contradiction that $S$ is the smallest perimeter polygon enclosing $P$, and there is at least one concave vertex $B$, whose is between two other vertices $A$ and $C$, so $B$ by definition has a inward angle greater than 180, given that this vertex is $B$ and its neighbours are $A$ and $C$, by the triangle inequality:
$$\begin{align*}
|AB| + |BC| > |AC|
\end{align*}$$
So take $S'$ formed by replacing edges $(A,B), (B,C)$ with the edge $(A,C)$, the perimeter of $S$ is strictly less than $S$'s, and we can apply the same argument for every concave vertex in $S'$, once obtaining a polygon without concave vertices, therefore being convex, contradicting our assumption that $S$ was the smallest perimeter polygon, and showing that the polygon we get must be convex.

$c)$ Okay so since $\rm conv(S)$ is by definition the intersection of all convex sets containing $S$, it follows that $\rm conv(S) \subseteq C$. where $C$ is any arbitrary convex hull containing the points of $S$.

$1.2)$ "The polygon $P$ (the convex hull of the set $'P$) can only be formed by the **extreme vertices** of $P'$. Since the set of extreme points is **uniquely defined** by $Pâ€²$, the polygon $P$ is uniquely determined.

Furthermore, $P$ is the **intersection of all convex sets** containing $P'$, because every convex set that contains $P'$ must also contain the extreme points of $P'$, and thus must contain their convex hull."


$1.3$ _"Let E be an unsorted set of n segments that are the edges of a convex polygon. Describe an $O(n log n)$ algorithm that computes from E a list containing all vertices of the polygon, sorted in clockwise order."

Lets divide the algorithm into two parts, computing the upper shell and the lower shell, then combining them to form the convex hull.

so take all points as ordered pairs of the form $(x,y)$, sort those points first by $x$ increasingly, then if there is a tie, sort by $y$, (lexicographical order),  then take the first point, it must be in the convex hull since its an extreme point.

Then take the a list $L_{upper}$ of points, add the first 2 points in order to $L_{upper}$ and repeat following procedure:

from $3$ to $n$
Add the next point.
- while the length of $L_{upper}$ is greater than $2$ and the last $3$ points do not make a right turn, remove the middle of the last three from $L$
Add $p_{n}$ and $p_{n-1}$to $L_{lower}$
from $n-2$ down to $1$
- while the length of $L_{lower}$ is greater than $2$ and the last $3$ points do not make a right turn, remove the middle of the last three from $L$
remove the first and last element of  $L_{lower}$ and append it to $L_{upper}$, then return $L$.
