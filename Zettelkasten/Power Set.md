To consider all combinations of a [[Sets|set]] $S$, we build a new set whose elements are the [[Subsets]] of $S$.

>The power set of $S$ is the set of all subsets of $S$. Denoted by $P(S)$

$$\begin{align*}
P(\{0,1,2\})\\
&= \{\emptyset, \{0\}, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{0,1\}, \{0,2\}, \{1,2\}, \{0,1,2\}\}
\end{align*}$$
A power set has $2^{n}$ elements where $n$ is the [[Cardinality]] of the original set.

See that the empty set ($\emptyset$) and $S$ itself are parts of the power set of $S$.
