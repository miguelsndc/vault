Two [[Event|events]] $A$ and $B$ are **independent** if, the occurrence of either events affect the [[Probability|probability]] of the other, that means:
$$\begin{align*}
P(A \mid B) &= P(A)
\end{align*}$$
$B$ occuring does not affect the probability of $A$, hence they're independent. also $P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$. Given that $P(A\mid B) = P(A)$.

**Disjoint** and **independent** events are fundamentally different, two events being disjoint mean that they cannot happen at the same time, and two events being independent means that their unrelated, this leads to:
- Disjoint events can't share outcomes, while independent events can;
- The probability of one independent event isn't affected by the occurrence of the event they're independent to; while the probability of one disjoint event is **completely** affected by the occurrence of the other, **since it can't happen anymore**. 
- Independent events can happen at the same time.
