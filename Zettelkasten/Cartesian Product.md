A Cartesian product is a relation between two *(or more)* [[Sets]]. The cartesian product itself is a set of ordered pairs wrapped in a [[Tuples|tuple]], where each tuple represent one possibility of relationship between one element from set $A$ and another element from set $B$, the cartesian product is the set of **all those possibilites**.

>Note that the cartesian product between $n$ sets, $A_{1} \times A_{2} \times A_{3}\times \cdots \times A_{n}$ will have a tuple of [[Cardinality]] $n$

By the [[Product Rule]], the cardinality of the cartesian product of $n$ sets will be the product of the cardinality of each set.
