A **Vector Space** is a collection, a bunch of [[Vector|vectors]], a [[Sets|set]], so to say, that obbey certain rules of addition and [[Multiplication by Scalar]]. 

There's [[Eight Axioms for Vector Spaces|eight axioms]] that a collection of vectors must obbey in order to be considered a vector space.
$\text{e.g.}$ 
$$\begin{align*}
R^{2}&= \Big\{ \begin{pmatrix}x \\ y\end{pmatrix} \mid x,y\in\mathbb{R} \Big\} 
\end{align*}$$
*All vectors in two-dimensional space* represent a vector space because they obbey all the [[Eight Axioms for Vector Spaces|eight axioms]].
Notice that anything that test positive for the axioms is a vector space and **anything contained in that vector space is a vector**. Vectors are
