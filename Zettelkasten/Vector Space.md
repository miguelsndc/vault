A **Vector Space** is a collection, a bunch of [[Vector|vectors]], a [[Sets|set]], so to say, that obbey certain rules of addition and [[Multiplication by Scalar]]. $\text{e.g.}$ 
$$\begin{align*}
R^{2}&= \Big\{ \begin{pmatrix}x \\ y\end{pmatrix} \mid x,y\in\mathbb{R} \Big\} 
\end{align*}$$
There's eight **axioms** that a collection of vectors must obbey in order to be considered a vector space:
1.  Associativity of vector addition:
2. $$
