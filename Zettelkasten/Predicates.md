Often regular propositional logic can't handle a wide variety of cases, that's why **predicate logic** exists. See the statement *"x > 3"*, we can't tell whether this is a proposition because we don't know the value of x.
We can actually produce propositions out of these statements, by creating subjects and predicates.

Let $p$ = *$x$ is greather than 3"* 
$p$ has two parts: "$x$", the subject; and "is greather than 3", the **predicate**, that refers to a property that the subject can have, we call it $P(x)$ where $P$ is the predicate *is greather than 3* and $x$ is the variable. It's also called a **Propositional function**.
