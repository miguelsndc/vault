To properly find the [[Inverse Matrix]] of some **invertible** [[Matrix Definition|matrix]] $A$, we perform the Gauss-Jordan idea of elimination, it says that by performing the [[Elimination in Matrices|elimination]] on $A$ to find it's [[Row Echelon]] form, and simultaneously performing the same operations in a adjacent [[Identity Matrix]] $I$, if $A$ is indeed invertible, $A$ will turn into the identity, and $I$ will turn into the inverse.
