Do not worry about the sentence making actual sense, logic and english are not meant to be interchangeable.

Search for keywords like: 
Let $p$  and $q$ be arbitrary [[Proposition|propositions]].
- **not, isn't**, overall negations for $\neg p$
- **and, together with** for $p \land q$
- **or** for $p \lor q$ 
- **only one of, $p$ or $q$ but not both**, for $p \oplus q$
- **If, then** for $p \implies q$
- **True together, A is true under the condition that B is true**, Basically search for sentences that restrict both of them to be of the same type for it to be true. $p \iff q$.
