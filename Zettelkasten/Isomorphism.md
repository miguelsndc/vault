When a [[Linear Transformations|linear transformation]] $T:V \rightarrow W$, is both [[Injective Linear Transformations|injective]] and [[Surjective Linear Transformations|surjective]], at the same time ([[Bijective Linear Transformations|bijective]]), it's called a *isomorphism*. When such transformation exist between two [[Vector Space|spaces]], they are *isomorphic*, Note that:
- By linear algebra's point of view, two isomorphic spaces are identical.
- Isomorphic spaces *must have the same [[Theorems and Proofs for Basis and Dimension|dimension]]*
- Isomorphism's take [[Theorems and Proofs for Basis and Dimension|basis]] to [[Theorems and Proofs for Basis and Dimension|basis]].
- Isomorphism's have a [[Inverse of a Linear Transformation|inverse transformation]] $T^{-1}: W \rightarrow V$.
