Latches and flip-flops are memory elements capable of storing 1-bit of information at a time. The difference between latches and flip-flops is that latches are [[Sequential Circuits|asynchronous]], that is, respond **immediately** to changes in input, while flip-flops are [[Sequential Circuits|synchronous]] and only change on discrete time intervals.

**Transparent Latches** are the asynchronous ones.
