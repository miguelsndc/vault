[[Subspace Intersection]] works by the regular [[Intersection]] definition of [[Sets]], however, joining two [[Linear Subspaces|subspaces]] requires more work that just a [[Union]]. 
Let $V$ be a [[Vector Space]] and $S_{1},S_{2}\subset V$ with $S_{1}$ and $S_2$ being subspaces.
Regular union as $S_{1}\cup S_{2}$ is not closed under addition, however it is under [[Scalar]] multiplication. Therefore by filling the gaps of addition there's a
