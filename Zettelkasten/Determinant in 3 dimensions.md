Let $a, b$ and $c$ be [[Vector|vectors]] in $\R^{3}$, the **determinant** $\det(a,b,c)$ equals the **volume** of the parallelepiped spanned by $a, b$ and $c$.
## Why is that ?
We know about areas of parallelograms using [[Cross Product|cross]] products, which is the area of the base, since the volume of a parallelepiped is $\f{area}(base) \cdot height$, we need to figure out the height.
