We say that a [[Functions|function]] is:
- **Even** if $f(x) = f(-x)$ for every $x$ in it's [[Domain]], this states that this function reflects over the $y$-axis, therefore we can plot the graph of $f$ only for $f(x) \ge 0$ and reflect it.
- **Odd** if $f(-x) = -f(x)$ in it's domain, this shows that this function reflects over the **origin**, we say that for *every negative $x$, we have a negative $y$*, if we plot for $f(x) \ge 0$, we can obtain the entire graph by rotating this part 180ยบ about the origin.
