The plane intersect form of a line in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is denoted by a system of equations, where the two equations and planes and the intersection forms a line, it's kind of a [[Cartesian Line Equation]] for 3D coordinates. See:
$$\begin{align*}
r:\begin{cases}
3x+2y+4z=10\\
2x+y+z=2
\end{cases}
\end{align*}$$
