The Binomial Theorem is related to the expansion of [[Polynomials]] of the form $(x+y)^{n}$
with $n\in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$. 

> [!tip] Theorem
> Let $x$ and $y$ be variables, and let $n$ be a nonnegative integer, then: $$(x+y)^{n} = \sum_{j=0}^{n}{n\choose k} x^{n-j}y^{j}
= {n \choose 0}x^{n}+ {n\choose 1}x^{n-1}y+{n\choose 2}x^{n-2}y^{2}+\cdots+{n\choose n}y^{n}$$

Before giving a proof of this theorem, let's reason about the expansion of $(x+y)^{3}$. First, it can be written as $(x+y)$
