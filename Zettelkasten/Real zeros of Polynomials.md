If $P$ is a [[Polynomials|polynomial]] and $c$ is a [[Real Numbers|real number]], then the following are equivalent:
- $c$ is a zero of $P$.
- $x=c$ is a solution for the [[Equation]] $P(x) = 0$ 
- $c$ is a [[Intercepts|x-intercept]] of the [[Graph of a Function|graph]] of $P$
- $x -c$ is a factor of $P$
