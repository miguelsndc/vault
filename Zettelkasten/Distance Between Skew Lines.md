The distance between skew lines can be given by the [[Scalar Triple Product]] of two [[Parametric Line Equation|parametric lines]] [[Vector|vector]] components and a difference between two points of each line, divided by the [[Cross Product]] of the vectors. See:

$$\begin{align*}
\frac{|\vec{Vdr},\vec{Vds},Pr-Ps|}{||\vec{Vdr}\times\vec{Vds}||}
\end{align*}$$
Perhaps if the line is a [[Plane Intersect Line]] you might need to know [[How to Find Direction Vector of Plane Intersect Line]].

Where:
- $\vec{Vdr}$ Direction vector of line $r$ .
- $\vec{Vds}$ Direction vector of line $s$.
- $Pr$ is a point in line $r$.
- $Ps$ is a point in line $s$.
