A *defective* [[Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors|eigenvalue]] $\lambda$ is a eigenvalue whose [[Algebraic Multiplicity]] is greater than it's [[Geometric Multiplicity]]. 

This that it's multiplicity as a root of the [[Characteristic polynomial]] is greather than the [[Theorems and Proofs for Basis and Dimension|dimension]] of it's [[Eigenspace]]. Hence the sum of all [[Geometric Multiplicity]] is less than the dimension of the space, and a [[Theorems and Proofs for Basis and Dimension|basis]] formed of [[Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors|eigenvectors]] cannot exist.
 
The existance of a defective eigenvalue $\lambda$ implies that it's [[Matrix Definition|matrix]] is a [[Defective matrix]], and is non-[[Diagonalizable Matrices|diagonalizable]].
