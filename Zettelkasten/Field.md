A field is any [[Sets|set]] of elements that satisfies the [[Field Axioms]] for both addition and multiplication, and is a commutative [[Division Algebra]].

Because the identity condition is usually different for addition and multiplication, a field must have at least $2$ elements. Examples include the [[Real Numbers]] $\mathbb{R}$, the [[Complex Numbers]] $\mathbb{C}$, the **Rational Numbers** $\mathbb{Q}$, *but not the **Integers*** $\mathbb{Z}$, because they form a [[Ring]].
