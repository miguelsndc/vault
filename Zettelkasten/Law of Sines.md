The law of sines relates the sides of a triangle and the sines of the angles opposite to them:

>[!tip] Definition
>In **any type of triangle**, given the the angles $A, B$ and $C$ and the sides $a, b$ and $c$, where $a$ is opposite to $A$, $b$ is opposite to $B$ and $c$ is opposite to $C$, the law of sines states that:
>
>$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{a}{\sin{A}}=\frac{b}{\sin{B}}=\frac{c}{\sin{C}}
\end{align*}
>$$

Forming a relation of proportin between the sides and the sine of their opposite angles.
