The law of sines relates the sides of a triangle and the sines of the [[Angle|angles]] opposite to them:

>[!tip] Definition
>In **any type of triangle**, given the the angles $A, B$ and $C$ and the sides $a, b$ and $c$, where $a$ is opposite to $A$, $b$ is opposite to $B$ and $c$ is opposite to $C$, the law of sines states that:
>
>$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{a}{\sin{A}}=\frac{b}{\sin{B}}=\frac{c}{\sin{C}}
\end{align*}
>$$

Forming a relation of proportin between the sides and the sine of their opposite angles.
## This is Useful when:
- We know two angles and any side;
- Two angles and the area;
- *(Sometimes)* two sides and one angle;
# Proof
Let $\triangle ABC$ be an oblique triangle, then $\triangle ABC$ can be *acute* or *obtuse* as shown in the figure:

See that $\sin{A} = \frac{h}{b}$ and $\sin{B}=\frac{h}{a}$, so it follows that:
$$\begin{align*}
h&= b\sin{A}\\
h&= a\sin{B}\\
\therefore b\sin{A}&= a\sin{B}\\
\frac{b\sin{A}}{\sin{A}\sin{B}} &= \frac{a\sin{B}}{\sin{A}\sin{B}}\\
\frac{b}{\sin{B}}&= \frac{a}{\sin{A}}
\end{align*}$$
In figure $(b)$ we have $\sin{180\degree} - B = \sin{B}=\frac{h}{b}$ so we're good.
