A Geometric sequence is a sum of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the **common ratio**, For example, the sequence $2,6,18,54\cdots$ is has a common ratio of $3$.

Examples of geometric sequences are powers $r^{k}$, of a fixed non-zero number $r$, like $2^{k}$, The general form is:
$$\begin{align*}
a,ar,ar^2,ar^3,\cdots,ar^{n-1},ar^{n}
\end{align*}$$
Where $r\ne0$ is the common ratio and $a$ is known as a scale factor.

We can find any term of such sequences by multiplying the scale factor $a$ by the **ratio** raised to a power $n-1$, where $n$ is the power we want, since $ar^{0}$ is the first term.
$$\begin{align*}
10,30,90,270,\cdots
\end{align*}$$
The ratio os $3$ and the scale factor is $10$, we can find the $4$th term as follows:
$$\begin{align*}
10\cdot3^{4-1}=10\cdot3^{3}=270
\end{align*}$$
Which is indeed the fourth term.
