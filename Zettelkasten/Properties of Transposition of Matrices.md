The [[Transposes]] of [[Matrix Definition|matrices]] follow a [[Sets|set]] of rules:
 - The transpose of the transpose is the matrix itself:$$\begin{align*}
(A^{T})^{T} &= A
\end{align*}$$
- The transpose of a [[Matrix Multiplication|multiplication]] is the transpose of each matrix in reverse order:
$$\begin{align*}
(AB)^{T}=B^{T}A^{T}
\end{align*}$$
- By multiplying a nonsquare matrix by its transpose, we obtain a [[Symmetric Matrix]}.
	- Symmetric matrices $S$ are equal to their transpose, $S^{T} = S \implies \text{S is Symmetric}$.
- Transposes respect addition: $(A+B)^{T}=A^{T}+B^{T}$ 
- Transpose of a [[Scalar|scalar]] is the same scalar: $(cA)^{T}=cA^{T}$
- The inverse of a transpose is the transpose of the [[Propositional Inverse|inverse]] of the original matrix: $(A^{T})^{-1}=(A^{-1})^{T}$
