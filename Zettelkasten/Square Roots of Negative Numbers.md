Just like positive [[Real Numbers]] have two square roots ($\sqrt{r}$ and $-\sqrt{r}$), every negative number also has two square roots. 

if $-r$ is a negative number than it's square roots are $\pm i\sqrt{r}$.
We usually write $i\sqrt{b}$ instead of $\sqrt{b}i$ to avoid confusion with $\sqrt{bi}$ 

> When multiplying to radicals of negative numbers, expressem them first in the form $i\sqrt{r}$ (where $r\gt0$) to avoid errors.
