Does what the name says, counts. if we want to have a **binary counter** that can count up to $2^{n}-1$ we need **n** flip-flops connected in parallel to the same clock sifnal
#### Steps to build a counter:
1. Find the required number of **flip-flops**.
2. Draw the **state diagram**
3. Select the flip-flop type and draw the excitation table
4. Find minimal expression for the excitation of each flip-flop
5. Draw the circuit
