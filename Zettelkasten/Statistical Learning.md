**Statistical Learning** refers to a set of tools and techniques used to estimate the relationship between a set of **variables** or **features** of a collection of measurements *(the dataset)*, we can state a more tied up definition:

*Given a set of $p$ called predictors $X=(X_{1}, X_{2}, \cdots, X_{p})$  and $Y$, called the response variable, statistical learning refers to the process of estimating $f$ such that $Y=f(X) + \epsilon$.
