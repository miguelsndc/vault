If $f$ is [[Differentiability and Continuity|continuous]] on $[a,b]$ and [[Differentiability and Continuity|differentiable]] on $(a,b)$, then there will be at least one $c \in (a,b)$ such that:
$$\begin{align*}
\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a} &= f'(c) \implies f(b)-f(a)=f'(c)(b-a)
\end{align*}$$
If $S$ is a [[Parametric Line Equation|line]] through the points $(a,f(a))$, $(b,f(b))$, then there will be at least one point $(c,f(c))$, with $a \lt c \lt b$ such that the line tangent to the graph of $f$, at this point, is parallel to $s$. Since $\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a}$ is the [[Average Rate of Change|slope]] of $s$, and $f'(c)$ th slope of $T$, then:
$$\begin{align*}
\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a}=f'(c)
\end{align*}$$
