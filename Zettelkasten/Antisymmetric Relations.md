A [[Relations|relation]] $R$ on a set $A$ such that if $(a,b) \in R$ and $(b,a) \in R$, then $a=b$, for all $a,b \in A$ is called *antisymmetric*. Notice that [[Symmetric Relations|symmetry]] and **antisymmetry** are not *mutually exclusive* relations, one can satisfy both at the same time, as well as none.
Though similar, antisymmetry and [[Reflexive Relations|reflexiveness]] are different, since antisymmetry **does not require all pairs $(a,a)$ to be in $R$** and reflexiveness does. Antisymmetry is more forgiving.
