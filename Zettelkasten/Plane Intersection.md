To find the intersection between two planes in a 3D Coordinate System, take the equations of the planes and form a system of equations. The intersection will be a [[Parametric Lines|line]]. 

Since we need **two points** or a **point and a vector** to determine the equation of the line, we need to arbitrate values on one of the coordinates, since we can't really solve systems of three variables and two equations.

By solving this by arbitrating values on one of the axis, we can find two points and form a proper line equation.
