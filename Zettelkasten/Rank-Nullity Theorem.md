Let $M$ be a $m\times n$ [[Matrix Definition|matrix]], the [[Rank of a Matrix|rank]] of $M$ is the number of columns with [[Pivot|pivots]], the **nullity** of $M$ is the number of columns *without pivots*. The theorem states that:
$$\begin{align*}
\rm{rank}(M) + \rm{null}(M)=n
\end{align*}$$
Where $n$ is the number of columns of $M$, the nullity is also the [[Theorems and Proofs for Basis and Dimension|dimension]] of the [[Kernel of a linear transformation|kernel]] of the [[Linear Transformations|linear transformation]] denoted by $M$.
