A System of linear [[Equation|equations]] is a structure defined when multiple equations that share that same variables are forced to cohexist in order to force a common solution that solves all equations at the same time.

>[!tip] Definition
>A System of linear equations with $m$ equations and $n$ variables is a [[Sets|set]] of equations of the form:
> $$\begin{align*}
(*) &= \begin{cases}
a_{11}x_{1}+a_{12}x_{2}+\cdots+a_{1n}x_{n}=b_{1}\\
a_{21}x_{1}+a_{22}x_{2}+\cdots+a_{2n}x_{n}=b_{2}\\
\quad \vdots \qquad\quad \vdots \qquad\qquad\quad\;\vdots \qquad\quad \vdots \\
a_{m1}x_{1}+a_{m2}x_{2}+\cdots+a_{mn}x_{n}=b_{m}
\end{cases} 
\end{align*}$$
> With $a_{ij}, 1\le i \le m, 1\le j \le n$, [[Real Numbers]] (or [[Complex Numbers]])

The solution of the system $(*)$ is a [[Tuples|tuple]] $(x_{1}, x_{2},\cdots, x_{n})$ that simultaneously satisfy all the $m$ equations defined, Two system are equivalent [[If and Only if|if and only if]] every solution on one system is also solution to the other.
