[[Law of Sines]] is good to realte sides and [[Angle|angles]], but with three sides and no angles, law of sines can't be applied since it depends on the relation of the angles, that's when the **Law of Cosines** comes in:

>[!tip] Law of Cosines
>Identity that relates sides to angles in a triangle, has two main forms:
>$1$*st* form: $\cos{C}= \frac{a^{2}+b^{2}-c^{2}}{2ab}$ 
>$2$*nd* form: $c^{2} = a^{2}+b^{2}-2ab\cos{C}$

The first form is used to find the angles of a triangle when only sides are known: *the cosine of an angle $\theta$ is the sum of the squares of the two adjacent sides minus the square of the opposite side, divided by $2$ times the adjacent sides*. Notice we can find the angle by $\arccos{\theta}$.

The second form allow us to find the length of a side opposite two an angle $C$ between two known sides. *the square of a side $c$ is the sum of the squares of the other sides minus 2 times cosine of the angle opposite to $C$ and the other sides*.
It's a general form of [[Pythagorean Theorem]], but with the $2ab\cos{C}$ correction factor, to it works not only for [[Right Triangle|right triangles]].
