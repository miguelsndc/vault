[[Law of Sines]] is good to realte sides and [[Angle|angles]], but with three sides and no angles, law of sines can't be applied since it depends on the relation of the angles, that's when the **Law of Cosines** comes in:

>[!tip] Law of Cosines
>Identity that relates sides to angles in a triangle, has two main forms:
>$1$*st* form: $\cos{C}= \frac{a^{2}+b^{2}-c^{2}}{-2ab\c$ 
>$2$*nd* form: $c^{2} = a^{2}+b^{2}-2ab\cos{C}$

The first form let us
