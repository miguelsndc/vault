In case of [[Functions]] in general, [[Strategies to Prove Surjectivity|surjectivity]] is defined as: Let $f: A \rightarrow B$, then if is surjective if and only if $\forall b \in B \;\; \exists a \in A \mid f(a) = b$. When talking about [[Linear Transformations]], surjectivity is defined through the [[Image of a linear transformation|image]]: 
Let $T:V \rightarrow W$ be a linear transformation, $T$ is surjective [[If and Only if|if and only if]], $\im(T) =W$, since $\im(T) \subset W$, if the [[Theorems and Proofs for Basis and Dimension|dimension]] of $W$ and $\im(T)$ are the same then $\im(T) = W$. ($\dim[\im(T)] = \dim(W)$.
So let [[]]
