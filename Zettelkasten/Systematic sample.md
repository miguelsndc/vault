It's a [[Sample|sample]]ing technique where you take every member of the [[Population|population]], assign some numerical value to it Then choose every $k$-th person in the population list. 
Where $k$ is a pre-determined sampling interval, and it's calculated by dividing the population size by the desired sample size.
