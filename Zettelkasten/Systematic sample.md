It's a [[Sample|sample]]ing technique where you take every member of the [[Population|population]], assign some numerical value to it. Then pick a start number, let's say $1$, but it could be any. Then choose every $k$-th person in the population list.
If one starts at $2$ with $k=12$, then $2, 14, 26, 38, 50, \cdots$ would be chosen to the [[Sample|sample]]. This techniques imitates the benefits of [[Simple random]].
