A [[Functions|function]] $P$ is called  *probability* if it satisfies the following conditions:
- $0 \le P \le 1, \; \forall A \subset \Omega$.
- $P(\Omega)=1$.
- $P(\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{n}A_{i})= \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}P(A_{i})$, with [[Disjoint Set|disjoint]] $A_{i}$'s.
Where $\Omega$ is the [[Sample Space]] and $A_{i}$ is the $i$th [[Event]] of $\Omega$. Probabilities can be assigned in various ways, we can use theoretical information about the phenomena, for example, rolling a dice, of course regarded all the details for a fair roll, each side has a probability of $\frac{1}{6}$, that is, $P(1) = P(2) = \cdots = P(6)= \frac{1}{6}$.
Another technique is through the observation of a occurrence frequency. After observing a phenomena for a reasonable amount of time, we can assign the variable of interest a probability that is associated to the relative frequency of that variable.
