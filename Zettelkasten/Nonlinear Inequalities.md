To solve inequalities involving squares and other powers, we use factoring, together with the [[Sign of a Product or Quotient]] principle.

### Rules for Solving

Nonlinear inequalities are kind of tricky, so we must follow a set of guidelines for solving them appropriately.

1. **Move all terms to one side**
	It's required that all non-zero terms of the inequality are grouped in one side, if necessary, rewrite the inequality as such. If it contains quotients, bring them to a common denominator.
2. **Factor**
	Factor the non-zero side of the inequality, so we can clearly see the factors it involves.
3. **Find the Intervals**
	Unlike [[Equation]]s, inequalities are satisfied by [[Intervals]] of numbers. We got to determine the values for which each factor is zero, and divide the real line. List the intervals that are determined by these numbers.
4. **Make a table or diagram**
	Use **test values** to make a table or diagram of the signs of each factor on each interval. In the last row determine the sign of the product (or quotient) of these factors.
5. **Solve**
	Use the sign table to find the intervals on which the inequality is satisfied. Check whether the endpoints of these intervals satisfy the inequality. (This may happen if the inequality involves $\le$ or $\ge$)
