If we want to emphasize that the [[S1/MD/Sets|set]] $A$ is a [[Subsets|subset]] of $B$ but $A\ne B$, we write:
$$\begin{align*}
A \subset B
\end{align*}$$
For $A \subset B$ to be true, it must be the case that $A\subseteq B$ and a element $x$ of $B$ that is not present in $A$, See:
$$\begin{align*}
\forall x(x \in A \implies x \in B) \land \exists x(x\in B \land x \notin A)
\end{align*}$$
