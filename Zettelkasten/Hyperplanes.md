A Hyperplane is a generalization of a *two-dimensional plane* in three-dimensional space to spaces of arbitrary dimension. Like a plane in space, a hyperplane in $\rm{n}$ dimensions is a flat *hypersurface*, a [[Linear Subspaces|subspace]] whose dimension is **one less** than the ambient space.
Lower dimensional examples of hyperplanes are one-dimensional lines in planes and two-dimensional planes in space.

>![Tip] definition
>In geometry, a **hyperplane** of a $n$-dimensional [[Vector Space|vector space]] $V$ is a [[Linear Subspaces|subspace]] of dimension $n-1$, or, equivalently, of [[Codimensions|codimension]] $1$.
