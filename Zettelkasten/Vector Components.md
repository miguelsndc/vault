We can describe a [[Vector]] from it's components, for example let $\vec{a}$ be a arbitrary vector, if we tell the $x$, $y$ and $z$ components of $a$ we can absolutely know which vector we're working with, See:
$$\begin{align*}
\vec{a}&= \begin{cases}
a_{x}&= p\\
a_{y}&= q\\
a_{z}&= r\\
\end{cases}\\\\

\vec{a} &= <a_{x},a_{y},a_{z}>
\end{align*}$$
