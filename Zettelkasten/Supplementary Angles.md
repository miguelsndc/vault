if two angles $A$ and $B$ add up to $\pi$ *($180\degree$)*. then they're **supplements** of each other.
## Things to know
- The sine of an angle equals the sine of it's supplement:
  $$\begin{align*}
\sin{143\degree}=\sin{37\degree} \because 143+37=180
\end{align*}$$
- The cosine of an angle equals **minus** the cosine of it's supplement:
  $$\begin{align*}
\cos{56\degree} &= -\cos{124\degree} \because124+56=180
\end{align*}$$
This happens because of the way the [[Unit Circle]] behaves when the angle gets past $\frac{\pi}{2}$, the $y$ axis becomes negative *so the $x$ coordinate gets negative*, hence the cosine gets negative ,but we are still above the $x$ axis, so the sine remains positive. 
When we reach angles $\theta$ such that: $180\degree \lt \theta \lt 360\degree$ the sine gets negative, because we are **below the $x$ axis** *$y$ coordinate gets negative*.
