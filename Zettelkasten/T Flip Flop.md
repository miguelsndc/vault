As discussed in [[JK Flip Flop]], the JK Flip-Flop **toggles its output when J and K are 1**, therefore, by **connecting both to a single input T**, we can obtain a **T Flip-Flop**, that toggles its output everytime the input **T** is high, straightforward.

**Characteristic equation is**: $Q_{n+1}= T \oplus Q_{n}$
