Granularity refers to the **level of detail** in data, a dataset that has **high granularity** would have more individual pieces of information. The more **subdividable** a dataset is, the more granular it is considered to be. In a time series, time can be divided into years, months, weeks, days, hours, the latter being the **highest in granularity**.
Think of granularity as literally grains, the more **fine** a substance is, the more granular it is. If it's made of huge 5cm chunks, it's definetly less granular than a substance composed of $10^{-4}$ centimeter chunks; Compare sand to gravel for example.
