It's the [[Matrix Definition|matrix]] that when multiplies another matrix $A_{m\times n}$, **exchanges** the rows of $A$.
In fact, it's a pure [[Identity Matrix]] with exchanged rows, since changing values is unnecessary. in $2\times 2$ it kinda looks like $A = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1&0\end{pmatrix}$, notice we just swapped rows $1$ and $2$.
