A defective [[Matrix Definition|matrix]] $A$ is a [[Square Matrix]], that does not have a complete [[Theorems and Proofs for Basis and Dimension|basis]] of [[Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors|eigenvectors]], and is therefore non [[Diagonalizable Matrices|diagonalizable]]. A $n\times n$ matrix is *defective* if and only if it does not have $n$ [[Linear (In)dependence.|linearly independent]] [[Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors|eigenvectors]].

if $A$ is defective, then it has at least one [[Defective Eigenvalue]].
