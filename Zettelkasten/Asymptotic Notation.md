The **asymptotic** efficiency of an algorithm tries to shed some light on the behaviour of that algorithm when the input sizes **tend to infinity**, quite literally from the concept of [[Epsilon-Delta Definition of a Limit|limits]] from calculus, usually an algorithm that is asymptotically more efficient tends to be more efficient on all but some small inputs.

Those asymptotic notations work for [[Functions]] in general, not only algorithms, they happen to be quite a fit for measuring efficiency of algorithms but **are not limited to algorithms**, in fact they're used to characterize **space** and even other types of functions, There are three types:
