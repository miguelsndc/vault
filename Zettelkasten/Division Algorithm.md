Let $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$, then there exists unique integers $q$ and $r$ with $0 \le r \lt d$, such that:
$$\begin{align*}
a=dq+r
\end{align*}$$
Where $a$ is the **dividend**, $d$ is the **divisor**, $q$ is the **quotient**, and $r$ is the **remainder**, The notation used to express the quotient and the remainder is: 
$$\begin{align*}
q&= a \operatorname{div} d\\
r&= a \bmod m\\
\end{align*}$$
> Note that the remainder $r$ can't be negative, since this goes against $0 \le r \lt d$.
