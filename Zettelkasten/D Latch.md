Asynchronous version of the [[D Flip-Flop]], the [[SR Latch]] is connected to a $D$ input, and it responds to $D$ now:

This can be converted into a **Gated** D Latch by being turned into a **Gated SR-Latch** first and then connecting *D* to both inputs of the enable gates, and can be further converted into a [[D Flip-Flop]] by connecting the enable input to the **clock**.
