Venn diagram's are a way to graphically represent a [[S1/MD/Sets|set]] and it's relations with other sets.
All sets in a venn diagram are contained within a **universal set**, a set that represents all objects in consideration. $e.g$ *If $V = \{a,e,i,o,u\}$, the set of vowels in the english alphabet, then the **universe** is all the 26 letters of the alphabet*. See:

![[Venn.excalidraw]]

The white circles are the sets and the **universe**.
