Let $V$ be a [[Vector Space|vector space]] and $T: V \rightarrow V$ be a [[Linear maps|linear map]]. Also let $E_{\lambda}$ be a [[Eigenspace]] of some [[Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors|eigenvalue]] $\lambda$ of $T$.
The geometric multiplicty $\gamma_{T}(\lambda)$ of $\lambda$ is the [[Theorems and Proofs for Basis and Dimension|dimension]] of the eigenspace associated to $\lambda$, in this case, $E$; $i.e$, the maximum number of [[Linear (In)dependence.|linearly independent]] [[Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors|eigenvectors]] associated with that eigenvalue. By the definition of [[Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors]], $\gamma_{T}(\lambda) \gt 1$ because every eigenvalue has at least one eigenvector associated to it.
