Let $f$ be a [[Functions|function]] defined over some interval $I$. A *antiderivative* of $f$ in $I$ is a function $F$, defined in $I$ such that:
$$\begin{align*}
F'(x)=f(x)
\end{align*}$$
For all $x \in I$.
$F$ being a antiderivative of $f$ in $I$, then, for every constant $k$, $F(x)+k$ is also a antiderivative of $f$. However, since [[Functions with the same derivative will differ by a constant]] on $I$, it follows that the antiderivatives of $f$ in $I$ are functions of the form $F(x) + k$ or $+ C$ (more commonly). So, we say:
$$\begin{align*}
y=F(x)+C
\end{align*}$$
is the family of antiderivatives of $f$ in $I$. The notation $\int f(x)dx$ will be used to represent it.

$F(x) = \frac{1}{3}x^{3}$ is a primitive of $f(x) = x^{2}$ because $F'(x)=f(x)=x^{2}$.P
