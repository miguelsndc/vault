If we know the [[Graph of a Function|graph]] of a [[Functions|function]] $y= f(x)$, to find graphs of both $y = -f(x)$ and $y=f(-x)$. We pay attention to two things:
- $y = -f(x)$ is simply the **negation** of every $y$-value of the function, so it's simply the original function but reflected over the $x$-axis
- $y = f(-x)$ works the same way, but it's the **negation** of every $x$-value, leading to a reflection over the $y$-axis.
