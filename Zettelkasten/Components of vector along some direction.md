Let's say we want to find the component of $a$ along the direction $u$ *($u$ is a unit vector)*, the length of the red segment is $\norm{a}\cos{\theta}$, since $u$ is unitary that equals $\norm{a} \norm{u} \cos{\theta}=a \cdot u$. 

> "Component" is the length of projection of $a$ along some direction $u$ (unitary vector). 

If we want to find the
