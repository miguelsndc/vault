Let $f$ be a [[Functions in Discrete Math|function]] and assume $A$ is a [[Real Numbers|real number]], and note that $f$ is a defined on some *neighborhood* of a point $p$. 

Note that we have two neighborhoods, $N_{1}(A)$, the neighborhood that tell us how close we want $f(x)$ to be to the [[Intuitive Definition of Limits|limit]] $A$ in the $y$ axis, and $N_{2}(p)$, that tell us how close $x$ should be of $p$ so $f(x)$ is whithin the neighborhood $N_{1}(a)$.

The essential part of the definition is, that for every $N_{1}(A)$, *there is* some $N_{2}(p)$ to satisfy it.

Let's call the distance of the neighborhoods from the limit $A$ and from the point $p$ as **radius**, the abrangence of the interval.

We can formulate the definition in terms of the radius of $N_{1}(A)$ and $N_{2}(p)$, it's conventional to name the radius of $N_{1}(A)$ as $\epsilon$, and the radius of $N_{2}(p)$ as $\delta$. The statement $f(x) \IN $
