## Friday (No Classes)
### Morning Block (9:00-12:00)
- 9:00-10:30: Multivariable Calculus (intensive session)
- 10:45-12:00: Linear Algebra practice

### Afternoon Block (14:00-17:00)
- 14:00-15:30: Deep Learning Book
- 15:45-17:00: Competitive Programming

## Saturday
### Morning Block (9:00-12:00)
- 9:00-10:30: Competitive Programming practice
- 10:45-12:00: Multivariable Calculus

### Afternoon Block (14:00-17:00)
- 14:00-15:30: Deep Learning Book
- 15:45-17:00: Projective Geometry (if other work is complete)

## Sunday
### Flexible Study Block (10:00-16:00)
- Primary focus: Weekly review and preparation
- Catch up on any subjects falling behind
- Buffer time for assignments and projects
- Projective Geometry if time permits

## Key Adjustments
1. **Commute Optimization**:
   - Use commute time for passive learning (audio lectures, concept review)
   - Lighter load on days with longer class schedules

2. **Energy Management**:
   - Heavier subjects scheduled when you're likely to be most alert
   - Lighter study load on days with multiple classes

3. **Time Block Strategy**:
   - Focused 1.5-hour blocks for primary subjects
   - 45-minute blocks for review and practice
   - Built-in breaks between sessions

4. **Priority Integration**:
   - Multivariable Calculus gets prime time slots
   - Linear Algebra integrated around class schedule
   - Competitive Programming concentrated on less busy days
