Roundoff errors arise from the finite precision of numerical representations in computers. When numbers with more decimal places than the precision allows are used, or when very large or very small numbers are approximated within the floating-point limit, discrepancies between the original and computed values occur, resulting in roundoff errors.
These errors can accumulate during calculations, especially in iterative processes, potentially affecting the accuracy of the final result. Awareness of roundoff errors is crucial, as their propagation can introduce inaccuracies in numerical computations.
