Roundoff errors are discrepancies between the results of the calculation done by a algorithm when the number given to it has different decimal places, $10$ or $10.000.000$ places, the precision of the input directly alters the result of the output, and this difference is a roundoff error.
When certain integers blow up the floating point limit and truncation is need so it can be computed, the disprepancy between the original number and the truncated one is a **roundoff error**.
This type of error needs to by taken account off because if a procedure is doing lots of calculations, if one of them has a roundoff error,
