To properly graph a [[Polynomial Functions|polynomial function]], follow these steps:
1. Factor the [[Polynomials|polynomial]] to find all it's [[Real zeros of Polynomials|real zeros]], these are the [[Intercepts|x-intercept]]s of the graph.
2. Make a table of values for the polynomials, check whether the graph lies above or below de $x$-axis on the [[Intervals]] determined by the zeros.
3. Find the [[End Behavior of a Polynomial|end behavior]] of the function.
4. Graph the points, make sure to draw a smooth curve between them that exhibits the determined end bahavior.
