Is a kind of [[Diagonal Matrix]], similarly, it has to be a [[Square Matrix]], but $a_{ii}=1$ and $a_{ij}=0$, *(elements with the same row and column index must be one and all others must be zero)*. $e.g.$ 
$$\begin{align*}I_{4\times4}&= 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}$$
But it has some special properties, when we do [[Matrix Multiplication]] by a identity matrix of similar dimesions, we get the other matrix **unchanged**, the identity matrix is called identity because it's like a $1$ in multiplication and $0$ in addition.
