Let $A$ be a $m\times n$ [[Matrix Definition|matrix]] of coefficients of a system $Ax = b$, our purpose is to eliminate numbers to make our [[Definition of a System of Linear Equations|system of linear equations]] easier to solve.
- We accept the first equation is *okay*, and take the first number in the first row as the **pivot**, the number used to eliminate another number in a lower column.
$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 2  & 1 \\ 3 & 8 & 2 \\ 0 & 4 & 1\end{bmatrix}
$$
