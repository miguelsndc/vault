A [[Relations|relation]] $R$ on a [[Sets|set]] $A$ is called *reflexive* if $(a,a) \in R$ for all $a \in A$. $\forall a ((a,a) \in R)$. 
Let $A = \{a,b,c\}$. $A$ will be reflexive if and only if:
$$\begin{align*}
(a,a) \in R\\
(b,b) \in R\\
(c,c) \in R
\end{align*}$$
A counter-example is enough to show that some relation $R$ is not reflexive.
