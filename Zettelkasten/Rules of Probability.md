[[Probability]] uses a lot of [[Sets|set]] theory and **counting** principles, as we'll see:
Let $A$ and $B$ be [[Event|events]] of a [[Sample Space]] $\Omega$ and $P$ the probability function. Then:
- $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$. See the [[Inclusion-Exclusion Principle]].
Let $A^{c}$ denote the **complementary event** of $A$, then:
- $P(A^{c})=1-P(A)$.
