>[!tip] Definition
>Let $a$ and $b$ be integers, not both zero. *The largest integer $d$ such that $d \mid b$ and $d \mid a$* is denoted by $\gcd(a,b)$.

The $\gcd$ can be found by either [[Prime Numbers|prime]] factorization and then just finding by eye the common largest, or by the following:
$$\begin{align*}
&\gcd(a,b) :\\
a&= p_{1}^{a_{1}} \cdot p_{2}^{a_{2}} \cdots p_{n}^{a_{n}}
\end{align*}$$
