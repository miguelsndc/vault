One to one [[Functions|functions]] are those who map to exactly one output. See:
###### Definition
A Function with [[Domain|domain]] $A$ is called a **one-to-one function** if no two elements have the same image (same output), that is:
$$\begin{align*}
f(x_{1}) \ne f(x_{2}) \;\text{whenever}\; x_{1}\ne x_{2}
\end{align*}$$
Or, equivalently:
$$\begin{align*}
\text{If} \; f(x_{1}) &= f(x_{2}) \; \text{then} \; x_{1}=x_{2}
\end{align*}$$
> A function is one-to-one if and only if **no horizontal line intersects it's graph more than once.** it would mean that $f(x_{1})= f(x_{2})$ and $x_{1}\ne x_{2}$. Which breaks the one-to-one constraints.
