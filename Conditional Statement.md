Is a relationship of two [[Proposition|propositions]] when one is last is a logical consequence of the first.
$p$ is called the *premise* and $q$ is called the *conclusion*. **Is true when both $p$ and $q$ are true and when $p$ is false**, the truth value of $q$ when $p$ it's true **doesn't matter** for the whole proposition.
##### Truth Table
| p   | q   | $p \implies q$ |

#### Frequently Used Terminology
Since conditional statements play a essential role in mathematical reasoning, it's often used in a ton of different ways, some of them are not that obvious, but they all mean the same. $p \implies q$. See:
- "$p$ is sufficient for $q$"
- "$q$ if $p$"
- "$q$ when $p$"
- "a necessary condition for $p$ is $q$"
- "q unless $\neg p$"
- "$q$ whenever $p$"
- "$q$ is necessary for $p$"
- "$q$ follows from $p$"
