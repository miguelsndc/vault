#### Context
A Tangent line to the [[Functions|function]] $f(x)$ at the point $x = a$ it's the line that touches the graph of the function at that point and it's "parallel" (some way) to the graph at that point. See:

Notice that at the second point the line touches the graph but **it's not** parallel to it. When we see this behaviour we will call it a **secant line**.
